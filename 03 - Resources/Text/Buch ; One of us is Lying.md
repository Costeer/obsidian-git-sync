#### Chapter One

**Bronwyn**

**Monday,	September	24,	2:55	p.m.**

A	sex	tape.	A	pregnancy	scare.	Two	cheating	scandals.	And	that’s	just
this	 week’s	 update.	 If	 all	 you	 knew	 of	 Bayview	 High	 was	 Simon
Kelleher’s	gossip	app,	you’d	wonder	how	anyone	found	time	to	go	to
class.

“Old	news,	Bronwyn,”	says	a	voice	over	my	shoulder.	“Wait	till	you
see	tomorrow’s	post.”

Damn.	I	hate	getting	caught	reading	About	That,	especially	by	its
creator.	I	lower	my	phone	and	slam	my	locker	shut.	“Whose	lives	are
you	ruining	next,	Simon?”

Simon	 falls	 into	 step	 beside	 me	 as	 I	 move	 against	 the	 flow	 of
students	heading	for	the	exit.	“It’s	a	public	service,”	he	says	with	a
dismissive	wave.	“You	tutor	Reggie	Crawley,	don’t	you?	Wouldn’t	you
rather	know	he	has	a	camera	in	his	bedroom?”

I	don’t	bother	answering.	Me	getting	anywhere	near	the	bedroom
of	perpetual	stoner	Reggie	Crawley	is	about	as	likely	as	Simon	growing
a	conscience.

“Anyway,	 they	 bring	 it	 on	 themselves.	 If	 people	 didn’t	 lie	 and
cheat,	 I’d	 be	 out	 of	 business.”	 Simon’s	 cold	 blue	 eyes	 take	 in	 my
lengthening	strides.	“Where	are	you	rushing	off	to?	Covering	yourself
in	extracurricular	glory?”

I	wish.	As	if	to	taunt	me,	an	alert	crosses	my	phone:	 _Mathlete
practice,	3	p.m.,	Epoch	Coffee._ 	Followed	by	a	text	from	one	of	my
teammates:	 _Evan’s	here._

Of	course	he	is.	The	cute	Mathlete—less	of	an	oxymoron	than	you
might	think—seems	to	only	ever	show	up	when	I	can’t.

“Not	exactly,”	I	say.	As	a	general	rule,	and	especially	lately,	I	try	to
give	Simon	as	little	information	as	possible.	We	push	through	green


metal	doors	to	the	back	stairwell,	a	dividing	line	between	the	dinginess
of	the	original	Bayview	High	and	its	bright,	airy	new	wing.	Every	year
more	wealthy	families	get	priced	out	of	San	Diego	and	come	fifteen
miles	east	to	Bayview,	expecting	that	their	tax	dollars	will	buy	them	a
nicer	school	experience	than	popcorn	ceilings	and	scarred	linoleum.

Simon’s	still	on	my	heels	when	I	reach	Mr.	Avery’s	lab	on	the	third
floor,	and	I	half	turn	with	my	arms	crossed.	“Don’t	you	have	someplace
to	be?”

“Yeah.	Detention,”	Simon	says,	and	waits	for	me	to	keep	walking.
When	I	grasp	the	knob	instead,	he	bursts	out	laughing.	“You’re	kidding
me.	You	too?	What’s	your	crime?”

“I’m	wrongfully	accused,”	I	mutter,	and	yank	the	door	open.	Three
other	students	are	already	seated,	and	I	pause	to	take	them	in.	Not	the
group	I	would	have	predicted.	Except	one.

Nate	Macauley	tips	his	chair	back	and	smirks	at	me.	“You	make	a
wrong	turn?	This	is	detention,	not	student	council.”

He	should	know.	Nate’s	been	in	trouble	since	fifth	grade,	which	is
right	around	the	time	we	last	spoke.	The	gossip	mill	tells	me	he’s	on
probation	with	Bayview’s	finest	for...something.	It	might	be	a	DUI;	it
might	be	drug	dealing.	He’s	a	notorious	supplier,	but	my	knowledge	is
purely	theoretical.

“Save	 the	 commentary.”	 Mr.	 Avery	 checks	 something	 off	 on	 a
clipboard	and	closes	the	door	behind	Simon.	High	arched	windows
lining	the	back	wall	send	triangles	of	afternoon	sun	splashing	across
the	 floor,	 and	 faint	 sounds	 of	 football	 practice	 float	 from	 the	 field
behind	the	parking	lot	below.

I	take	a	seat	as	Cooper	Clay,	who’s	palming	a	crumpled	piece	of
paper	like	a	baseball,	whispers	“Heads	up,	Addy”	and	tosses	it	toward
the	girl	across	from	him.	Addy	Prentiss	blinks,	smiles	uncertainly,	and
lets	the	ball	drop	to	the	floor.

The	classroom	clock	inches	toward	three,	and	I	follow	its	progress
with	a	helpless	feeling	of	injustice.	I	shouldn’t	even	 _be_ 	here.	I	should	be
at	Epoch	Coffee,	flirting	awkwardly	with	Evan	Neiman	over	differential
equations.

Mr.	 Avery	 is	 a	 give-detention-first,	 ask-questions-never	 kind	 of
guy,	but	maybe	there’s	still	time	to	change	his	mind.	I	clear	my	throat


and	start	to	raise	my	hand	until	I	notice	Nate’s	smirk	broadening.	“Mr.
Avery,	that	wasn’t	my	phone	you	found.	I	don’t	know	how	it	got	into
my	bag.	 _This_ 	is	mine,”	I	say,	brandishing	my	iPhone	in	its	melon-
striped	case.

Honestly,	you’d	have	to	be	clueless	to	bring	a	phone	to	Mr.	Avery’s
lab.	He	has	a	strict	no-phone	policy	and	spends	the	first	ten	minutes	of
every	class	rooting	through	backpacks	like	he’s	head	of	airline	security
and	we’re	all	on	the	watch	list.	My	phone	was	in	my	locker,	like	always.

“You	too?”	Addy	turns	to	me	so	quickly,	her	blond	shampoo-ad
hair	 swirls	 around	 her	 shoulders.	 She	 must	 have	 been	 surgically
removed	from	her	boyfriend	in	order	to	show	up	alone.	“That	wasn’t
my	phone	either.”

“Me	three,”	Cooper	chimes	in.	His	Southern	accent	makes	it	sound
like	 _thray._ 	He	and	Addy	exchange	surprised	looks,	and	I	wonder	how
this	 is	 news	 to	 them	 when	 they’re	 part	 of	 the	 same	 clique.	 Maybe
überpopular	 people	 have	 better	 things	 to	 talk	 about	 than	 unfair
detentions.

“Somebody	punked	us!”	Simon	leans	forward	with	his	elbows	on
the	desk,	looking	spring-loaded	and	ready	to	pounce	on	fresh	gossip.
His	 gaze	 darts	 over	 all	 four	 of	 us,	 clustered	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 the
otherwise	 empty	 classroom,	 before	 settling	 on	 Nate.	 “Why	 would
anybody	want	to	trap	a	bunch	of	students	with	mostly	spotless	records
in	detention?	Seems	like	the	sort	of	thing	that,	oh,	I	don’t	know,	a	guy
who’s	here	all	the	time	might	do	for	fun.”

I	look	at	Nate,	but	can’t	picture	it.	Rigging	detention	sounds	like
work,	and	everything	about	Nate—from	his	messy	dark	hair	to	his	ratty
leather	jacket—screams	 _Can’t	be	bothered._ Or	 yawns	 it,	 maybe.	 He
meets	my	eyes	but	doesn’t	say	a	word,	just	tips	his	chair	back	even
farther.	Another	millimeter	and	he’ll	fall	right	over.

Cooper	sits	up	straighter,	a	frown	crossing	his	Captain	America
face.	“Hang	on.	I	thought	this	was	just	a	mix-up,	but	if	the	same	thing
happened	to	all	of	us,	it’s	somebody’s	stupid	idea	of	a	prank.	And	I’m
missing	 _baseball	practice_ 	because	of	it.”	He	says	it	like	he’s	a	heart
surgeon	being	detained	from	a	lifesaving	operation.

Mr.	Avery	rolls	his	eyes.	“Save	the	conspiracy	theories	for	another
teacher.	I’m	not	buying	it.	You	all	know	the	rules	against	bringing
phones	to	class,	and	you	broke	them.”	He	gives	Simon	an	especially


sour	glance.	Teachers	know	About	That	exists,	but	there’s	not	much
they	can	do	to	stop	it.	Simon	only	uses	initials	to	identify	people	and
never	talks	openly	about	school.	“Now	listen	up.	You’re	here	until	four.
I	 want	 each	 of	 you	 to	 write	 a	 five-hundred-word	 essay	 on	 how
technology	is	ruining	American	high	schools.	Anyone	who	can’t	follow
the	rules	gets	another	detention	tomorrow.”

“What	do	we	write	with?”	Addy	asks.	“There	aren’t	any	computers
here.”	Most	classrooms	have	Chromebooks,	but	Mr.	Avery,	who	looks
like	he	should	have	retired	a	decade	ago,	is	a	holdout.

Mr.	Avery	crosses	to	Addy’s	desk	and	taps	the	corner	of	a	lined
yellow	 notepad.	 We	 all	 have	 one.	 “Explore	 the	 magic	 of	 longhand
writing.	It’s	a	lost	art.”

Addy’s	pretty,	heart-shaped	face	is	a	mask	of	confusion.	“But	how
do	we	know	when	we’ve	reached	five	hundred	words?”

“Count,”	Mr.	Avery	replies.	His	eyes	drop	to	the	phone	I’m	still
holding.	“And	hand	that	over,	Miss	Rojas.”

“Doesn’t	the	fact	that	you’re	confiscating	my	phone	 _twice_ 	give	you
pause?	Who	has	two	phones?”	I	ask.	Nate	grins,	so	quick	I	almost	miss
it.	“Seriously,	Mr.	Avery,	somebody	was	playing	a	joke	on	us.”

Mr.	 Avery’s	 snowy	 mustache	 twitches	 in	 annoyance,	 and	 he
extends	his	hand	with	a	beckoning	motion.	“ _Phone,_ 	Miss	Rojas.	Unless
you	 want	 a	 return	 visit.”	 I	 give	 it	 over	 with	 a	 sigh	 as	 he	 looks
disapprovingly	at	the	others.	“The	phones	I	took	from	the	rest	of	you
earlier	are	in	my	desk.	You’ll	get	them	back	after	detention.”	Addy	and
Cooper	 exchange	 amused	 glances,	 probably	 because	 their	 actual
phones	are	safe	in	their	backpacks.

Mr.	 Avery	 tosses	 my	 phone	 into	 a	 drawer	 and	 sits	 behind	 the
teacher’s	desk,	opening	a	book	as	he	prepares	to	ignore	us	for	the	next
hour.	 I	 pull	 out	 a	 pen,	 tap	 it	 against	 my	 yellow	 notepad,	 and
contemplate	the	assignment.	Does	Mr.	Avery	really	believe	technology
is	ruining	schools?	That’s	a	pretty	sweeping	statement	to	make	over	a
few	contraband	phones.	Maybe	it’s	a	trap	and	he’s	looking	for	us	to
contradict	him	instead	of	agree.

I	glance	at	Nate,	who’s	bent	over	his	notepad	writing	 _computers
suck_ 	over	and	over	in	block	letters.

```
It’s	possible	I’m	overthinking	this.
```

**Cooper**

**Monday,	September	24,	3:05	p.m.**

My	 hand	 hurts	 within	 minutes.	 It’s	 pathetic,	 I	 guess,	 but	 I	 can’t
remember	the	last	time	I	wrote	anything	longhand.	Plus	I’m	using	my
right	hand,	which	never	feels	natural	no	matter	how	many	years	I’ve
done	it.	My	father	insisted	I	learn	to	write	right-handed	in	second
grade	after	he	first	saw	me	pitch.	 _Your	left	arm’s	gold,_ 	he	told	me.
_Don’t	 waste	 it	 on	 crap	 that	 don’t	 matter._ Which	 is	 anything	 but
pitching	as	far	as	he’s	concerned.

That	 was	 when	 he	 started	 calling	 me	 Cooperstown,	 like	 the
baseball	hall	of	fame.	Nothing	like	putting	a	little	pressure	on	an	eight-
year-old.

Simon	reaches	for	his	backpack	and	roots	around,	unzipping	every
section.	He	hoists	it	onto	his	lap	and	peers	inside.	“Where	the	hell’s	my
water	bottle?”

“No	talking,	Mr.	Kelleher,”	Mr.	Avery	says	without	looking	up.
“I	know,	but—my	water	bottle’s	missing.	And	I’m	thirsty.”
Mr.	 Avery	 points	 toward	 the	 sink	 at	 the	 back	 of	 the	 room,	 its
counter	crowded	with	beakers	and	petri	dishes.	“Get	yourself	a	drink.
_Quietly._ ”

Simon	gets	up	and	grabs	a	cup	from	a	stack	on	the	counter,	filling
it	with	water	from	the	tap.	He	heads	back	to	his	seat	and	puts	the	cup
on	 his	 desk,	 but	 seems	 distracted	 by	 Nate’s	 methodical	 writing.
“Dude,”	he	says,	kicking	his	sneaker	against	the	leg	of	Nate’s	desk.
“Seriously.	Did	you	put	those	phones	in	our	backpacks	to	mess	with
us?”

Now	Mr.	Avery	looks	up,	frowning.	“I	said	 _quietly,_ 	Mr.	Kelleher.”
Nate	leans	back	and	crosses	his	arms.	“Why	would	I	do	that?”
Simon	shrugs.	“Why	do	you	do	anything?	So	you’ll	have	company
for	whatever	your	screw-up	of	the	day	was?”

“One	more	word	out	of	either	of	you	and	it’s	detention	tomorrow,”
Mr.	Avery	warns.

Simon	opens	his	mouth	anyway,	but	before	he	can	speak	there’s
the	sound	of	tires	squealing	and	then	the	crash	of	two	cars	hitting	each
other.	Addy	gasps	and	I	brace	myself	against	my	desk	like	somebody


just	rear-ended	me.	Nate,	who	looks	glad	for	the	interruption,	is	the
first	on	his	feet	toward	the	window.	“Who	gets	into	a	fender	bender	in
the	school	parking	lot?”	he	asks.

Bronwyn	looks	at	Mr.	Avery	like	she’s	asking	for	permission,	and
when	he	gets	up	from	his	desk	she	heads	for	the	window	as	well.	Addy
follows	her,	and	I	finally	unfold	myself	from	my	seat.	Might	as	well	see
what’s	going	on.	I	lean	against	the	ledge	to	look	outside,	and	Simon
comes	up	beside	me	with	a	disparaging	laugh	as	he	surveys	the	scene
below.

Two	cars,	an	old	red	one	and	a	nondescript	gray	one,	are	smashed
into	each	other	at	a	right	angle.	We	all	stare	at	them	in	silence	until	Mr.
Avery	lets	out	an	exasperated	sigh.	“I’d	better	make	sure	no	one	was
hurt.”	He	runs	his	eyes	over	all	of	us	and	zeroes	in	on	Bronwyn	as	the
most	responsible	of	the	bunch.	“Miss	Rojas,	keep	this	room	contained
until	I	get	back.”

“Okay,”	Bronwyn	says,	casting	a	nervous	glance	toward	Nate.	We
stay	at	the	window,	watching	the	scene	below,	but	before	Mr.	Avery	or
another	 teacher	 appears	 outside,	 both	 cars	 start	 their	 engines	 and
drive	out	of	the	parking	lot.

“Well,	that	was	anticlimactic,”	Simon	says.	He	heads	back	to	his
desk	and	picks	up	his	cup,	but	instead	of	sitting	he	wanders	to	the	front
of	the	room	and	scans	the	periodic	table	of	elements	poster.	He	leans
out	into	the	hallway	like	he’s	about	to	leave,	but	then	he	turns	and
raises	his	cup	like	he’s	toasting	us.	“Anyone	else	want	some	water?”

“I	do,”	Addy	says,	slipping	into	her	chair.
“Get	it	yourself,	princess.”	Simon	smirks.	Addy	rolls	her	eyes	and
stays	put	while	Simon	leans	against	Mr.	Avery’s	desk.	“Literally,	huh?
What’ll	you	do	with	yourself	now	that	homecoming’s	over?	Big	gap
between	now	and	senior	prom.”

Addy	looks	at	me	without	answering.	I	don’t	blame	her.	Simon’s
train	of	thought	almost	never	goes	anywhere	good	when	it	comes	to
our	friends.	He	acts	like	he’s	above	caring	whether	he’s	popular,	but	he
was	pretty	smug	when	he	wound	up	on	the	junior	prom	court	last
spring.	 I’m	 still	 not	 sure	 how	 he	 pulled	 that	 off,	 unless	 he	 traded
keeping	secrets	for	votes.

Simon	was	nowhere	to	be	found	on	homecoming	court	last	week,
though.	I	was	voted	king,	so	maybe	I’m	next	on	his	list	to	harass,	or


whatever	the	hell	he’s	doing.

“What’s	your	point,	Simon?”	I	ask,	taking	a	seat	next	to	Addy.
Addy	and	I	aren’t	close,	exactly,	but	I	kind	of	feel	protective	of	her.
She’s	 been	 dating	 my	 best	 friend	 since	 freshman	 year,	 and	 she’s	 a
sweet	girl.	Also	not	the	kind	of	person	who	knows	how	to	stand	up	to	a
guy	like	Simon	who	just	won’t	quit.

“She’s	a	princess	and	you’re	a	jock,”	he	says.	He	thrusts	his	chin
toward	 Bronwyn,	 then	 at	 Nate.	 “And	 you’re	 a	 brain.	 And	 you’re	 a
criminal.	You’re	all	walking	teen-movie	stereotypes.”

“What	about	you?”	Bronwyn	asks.	She’s	been	hovering	near	the
window,	but	now	goes	to	her	desk	and	perches	on	top	of	it.	She	crosses
her	 legs	 and	 pulls	 her	 dark	 ponytail	 over	 one	 shoulder.	 Something
about	her	is	cuter	this	year.	New	glasses,	maybe?	Longer	hair?	All	of	a
sudden,	she’s	kind	of	working	this	sexy-nerd	thing.

“I’m	the	omniscient	narrator,”	Simon	says.
Bronwyn’s	brows	rise	above	her	black	frames.	“There’s	no	such
thing	in	teen	movies.”

“Ah,	but	Bronwyn.”	Simon	winks	and	chugs	his	water	in	one	long
gulp.	“There	 _is_ 	such	a	thing	in	life.”

He	says	it	like	a	threat,	and	I	wonder	if	he’s	got	something	on
Bronwyn	for	that	stupid	app	of	his.	I	hate	that	thing.	Almost	all	my
friends	 have	 been	 on	 it	 at	 one	 point	 or	 another,	 and	 sometimes	 it
causes	 real	 problems.	 My	 buddy	 Luis	 and	 his	 girlfriend	 broke	 up
because	of	something	Simon	wrote.	Though	it	 _was_ 	a	true	story	about
Luis	hooking	up	with	his	girlfriend’s	cousin.	But	still.	That	stuff	doesn’t
have	to	be	published.	Hallway	gossip	is	bad	enough.

And	if	I’m	being	honest,	I’m	pretty	freaked	at	what	Simon	could
write	about	me	if	he	put	his	mind	to	it.

Simon	holds	his	cup	up,	grimacing.	“This	tastes	like	crap.”	He
drops	the	cup,	and	I	roll	my	eyes	at	his	attempt	at	drama.	Even	when
he	falls	to	the	floor,	I	still	think	he’s	messing	around.	But	then	the
wheezing	starts.

Bronwyn’s	on	her	feet	first,	then	kneeling	beside	him.	“Simon,”
she	says,	shaking	his	shoulder.	“Are	you	okay?	What	happened?	Can
you	 talk?”	 Her	 voice	 goes	 from	 concerned	 to	 panicky,	 and	 that’s
enough	 to	 get	 me	 moving.	 But	 Nate’s	 faster,	 shoving	 past	 me	 and


crouching	next	to	Bronwyn.

“A	pen,”	he	says,	his	eyes	scanning	Simon’s	brick-red	face.	“You
have	a	pen?”	Simon	nods	wildly,	his	hand	clawing	at	his	throat.	I	grab
the	pen	off	my	desk	and	try	to	hand	it	to	Nate,	thinking	he’s	about	to
do	an	emergency	tracheotomy	or	something.	Nate	just	stares	at	me	like
I	have	two	heads.	“An	 _epinephrine_ 	pen,”	he	says,	searching	for	Simon’s
backpack.	“He’s	having	an	allergic	reaction.”

Addy	stands	and	wraps	her	arms	around	her	body,	not	saying	a
word.	Bronwyn	turns	to	me,	face	flushed.	“I’m	going	to	find	a	teacher
and	call	nine-one-one.	Stay	with	him,	okay?”	She	grabs	her	phone	out
of	Mr.	Avery’s	drawer	and	runs	into	the	hallway.

I	kneel	next	to	Simon.	His	eyes	are	bugging	out	of	his	head,	his
lips	are	blue,	and	he’s	making	horrible	choking	noises.	Nate	dumps	the
entire	contents	of	Simon’s	backpack	on	the	floor	and	scrabbles	through
the	mess	of	books,	papers,	and	clothes.	“Simon,	where	do	you	keep	it?”
he	asks,	tearing	open	the	small	front	compartment	and	yanking	out
two	regular	pens	and	a	set	of	keys.

Simon’s	way	past	talking,	though.	I	put	one	sweaty	palm	on	his
shoulder,	like	that’ll	do	any	good.	“You’re	okay,	you’re	gonna	be	okay.
We’re	 gettin’	 help.”	 I	 can	 hear	 my	 voice	 slowing,	 thickening	 like
molasses.	My	accent	always	comes	out	hard	when	I’m	stressed.	I	turn
to	Nate	and	ask,	“You	sure	he’s	not	chokin’	on	somethin’?”	Maybe	he
needs	the	Heimlich	maneuver,	not	a	freaking	medical	pen.

Nate	ignores	me,	tossing	Simon’s	empty	backpack	aside.	“Fuck!”
he	yells,	slamming	a	fist	on	the	floor.	“Do	you	keep	it	on	you,	Simon?
Simon!”	Simon’s	eyes	roll	back	in	his	head	as	Nate	digs	around	in
Simon’s	 pockets.	 But	 he	 doesn’t	 find	 anything	 except	 a	 wrinkled
Kleenex.

Sirens	blare	in	the	distance	as	Mr.	Avery	and	two	other	teachers
race	in	with	Bronwyn	trailing	behind	them	on	her	phone.	“We	can’t
find	his	EpiPen,”	Nate	says	tersely,	gesturing	to	the	pile	of	Simon’s
things.

Mr.	Avery	stares	at	Simon	in	slack-jawed	horror	for	a	second,	then
turns	to	me.	“Cooper,	the	nurse’s	office	has	EpiPens.	They	should	be
labeled	in	plain	sight.	 _Hurry!_ ”

I	run	into	the	hallway,	hearing	footsteps	behind	me	that	fade	as	I
quickly	reach	the	back	stairwell	and	yank	the	door	open.	I	take	the


stairs	three	at	a	time	until	I’m	on	the	first	floor,	and	weave	through	a
few	straggling	students	until	I	get	to	the	nurse’s	office.	The	door’s	ajar,
but	nobody’s	there.

It’s	 a	 cramped	 little	 space	 with	 the	 exam	 table	 up	 against	 the
windows	and	a	big	gray	storage	cabinet	looming	to	my	left.	I	scan	the
room,	 my	 eyes	 landing	 on	 two	 wall-mounted	 white	 boxes	 with	 red
block	 lettering.	 One	 reads	 EMERGENCY	 DEFIBRILLATOR,	 the	 other
EMERGENCY	EPINEPHRINE.	I	fumble	at	the	latch	on	the	second	one	and
pull	it	open.

There’s	nothing	inside.
I	open	the	other	box,	which	has	a	plastic	device	with	a	picture	of	a
heart.	I’m	pretty	sure	that’s	not	it,	so	I	start	rummaging	through	the
gray	storage	cabinet,	pulling	out	boxes	of	bandages	and	aspirin.	I	don’t
see	anything	that	looks	like	a	pen.

“Cooper,	did	you	find	them?”	Ms.	Grayson,	one	of	the	teachers
who’d	entered	the	lab	with	Mr.	Avery	and	Bronwyn,	barrels	into	the
room.	She’s	panting	hard	and	clutching	her	side.

I	gesture	toward	the	empty	wall-mounted	box.	“They	should	be
there,	right?	But	they’re	not.”

“Check	the	supply	cabinet,”	Ms.	Grayson	says,	ignoring	the	Band-
Aid	 boxes	 scattered	 across	 the	 floor	 that	 prove	 I’ve	 already	 tried.
Another	teacher	joins	us,	and	we	tear	the	office	apart	as	the	sound	of
sirens	gets	closer.	When	we’ve	opened	the	last	cabinet,	Ms.	Grayson
wipes	a	trickle	of	sweat	from	her	forehead	with	the	back	of	her	hand.
“Cooper,	 let	 Mr.	 Avery	 know	 we	 haven’t	 found	 anything	 yet.	 Mr.
Contos	and	I	will	keep	looking.”

I	get	to	Mr.	Avery’s	lab	the	same	time	the	paramedics	do.	There
are	three	of	them	in	navy	uniforms,	two	pushing	a	long	white	stretcher,
one	racing	ahead	to	clear	the	small	crowd	that’s	gathered	around	the
door.	I	wait	until	they’re	all	inside	and	slip	in	behind	them.	Mr.	Avery’s
slumped	next	to	the	chalkboard,	his	yellow	dress	shirt	untucked.	“We
couldn’t	find	the	pens,”	I	tell	him.

He	runs	a	shaking	hand	through	his	thin	white	hair	as	one	of	the
paramedics	stabs	Simon	with	a	syringe	and	the	other	two	lift	him	onto
the	stretcher.	“God	help	that	boy,”	he	whispers.	More	to	himself	than
to	me,	I	think.


Addy’s	standing	off	to	the	side	by	herself,	tears	rolling	down	her
cheeks.	I	cross	over	to	her	and	put	an	arm	around	her	shoulders	as	the
paramedics	maneuver	Simon’s	stretcher	into	the	hallway.	“Can	you
come	along?”	one	asks	Mr.	Avery.	He	nods	and	follows,	leaving	the
room	empty	except	for	a	few	shell-shocked	teachers	and	the	four	of	us
who	started	detention	with	Simon.

Barely	fifteen	minutes	ago,	by	my	guess,	but	it	feels	like	hours.
“Is	he	okay	now?”	Addy	asks	in	a	strangled	voice.	Bronwyn	clasps
her	phone	between	her	palms	like	she’s	using	it	to	pray.	Nate	stands
with	his	hands	on	his	hips,	staring	at	the	door	as	more	teachers	and
students	start	trickling	inside.

```
“I’m	gonna	go	out	on	a	limb	and	say	no,”	he	says.
```

**Addy**

**Monday,	September	24,	3:25	p.m.**

Bronwyn,	Nate,	and	Cooper	are	all	talking	to	the	teachers,	but	I	can’t.	I
need	Jake.	I	pull	my	phone	out	of	my	bag	to	text	him	but	my	hands	are
shaking	too	bad.	So	I	call	instead.

“Baby?”	 He	 picks	 up	 on	 the	 second	 ring,	 sounding	 surprised.
We’re	not	big	callers.	None	of	our	friends	are.	Sometimes	when	I’m
with	Jake	and	his	phone	rings,	he	holds	it	up	and	jokes,	“What	does
‘incoming	call’	mean?”	It’s	usually	his	mom.

“Jake”	is	all	I	can	get	out	before	I	start	bawling.	Cooper’s	arm	is
still	around	my	shoulders,	and	it’s	the	only	thing	keeping	me	up.	I’m
crying	too	hard	to	talk,	and	Cooper	takes	the	phone	from	me.

“Hey,	man.	’S	Cooper,”	he	says,	his	accent	thicker	than	normal.
“Where	 you	 at?”	 He	 listens	 for	 a	 few	 seconds.	 “Can	 you	 meet	 us
outside?	There’s	been...Somethin’	happened.	Addy’s	real	upset.	Naw,
she’s	fine,	but...Simon	Kelleher	got	hurt	bad	in	detention.	Ambulance
took	him	an’	we	dunno	if	he’s	gon’	be	okay.”	Cooper’s	words	melt	into
one	another	like	ice	cream,	and	I	can	hardly	understand	him.

Bronwyn	turns	to	the	closest	teacher,	Ms.	Grayson.	“Should	we
stay?	Do	you	need	us?”

Ms.	Grayson’s	hands	flutter	around	her	throat.	“Goodness,	I	don’t
suppose	so.	You	told	the	paramedics	everything?	Simon...took	a	drink
of	 water	 and	 collapsed?”	 Bronwyn	 and	 Cooper	 both	 nod.	 “It’s	 so
strange.	He	has	a	peanut	allergy,	of	course,	but...you’re	sure	he	didn’t
eat	anything?”

Cooper	gives	me	my	phone	and	runs	a	hand	through	his	neatly
cropped	sandy	hair.	“I	don’t	think	so.	He	just	drank	a	cup	of	water	an’
fell	over.”

```
“Maybe	it	was	something	he	had	with	lunch,”	Ms.	Grayson	says.
```

“It’s	possible	he	had	a	delayed	reaction.”	She	looks	around	the	room,
her	eyes	settling	on	Simon’s	discarded	cup	on	the	floor.	“I	suppose	we
should	put	this	aside,”	she	says,	brushing	past	Bronwyn	to	pick	it	up.
“Somebody	might	want	to	look	at	it.”

“I	want	to	go,”	I	burst	out,	swiping	at	the	tears	on	my	cheeks.	I
can’t	stand	being	in	this	room	another	second.

“Okay	if	I	help	her?”	Cooper	asks,	and	Ms.	Grayson	nods.	“Should
I	come	back?”

“No,	that’s	all	right,	Cooper.	I’m	sure	they’ll	call	you	if	they	need
you.	Go	home	and	try	to	get	back	to	normal.	Simon’s	in	good	hands
now.”	She	leans	in	a	little	closer,	her	tone	softening.	“I	am	so	sorry.
That	must	have	been	awful.”

She’s	 mostly	 looking	 at	 Cooper,	 though.	 There’s	 not	 a	 female
teacher	at	Bayview	who	can	resist	his	all-American	charm.

Cooper	keeps	an	arm	around	me	on	the	way	out.	It’s	nice.	I	don’t
have	brothers,	but	if	I	did,	I	imagine	this	is	how	they’d	prop	you	up
when	you	felt	sick.	Jake	wouldn’t	like	most	of	his	friends	being	this
close	to	me,	but	Cooper’s	fine.	He’s	a	gentleman.	I	lean	into	him	as	we
pass	posters	for	last	week’s	homecoming	dance	that	haven’t	been	taken
down	yet.	Cooper	pushes	the	front	door	open,	and	there,	thank	God,	is
Jake.

I	collapse	into	his	arms,	and	for	a	second,	everything’s	okay.	I’ll
never	forget	seeing	Jake	for	the	first	time,	freshman	year:	he	had	a
mouth	full	of	braces	and	hadn’t	gotten	tall	or	broad-shouldered	yet,
but	I	took	one	look	at	his	dimples	and	summer	sky–blue	eyes	and
_knew._ 	He	was	the	one	for	me.	It’s	just	a	bonus	he	turned	out	beautiful.

He	strokes	my	hair	while	Cooper	explains	in	a	low	voice	what
happened.	“God,	Ads,”	Jake	says.	“That’s	awful.	Let’s	get	you	home.”

Cooper	leaves	on	his	own,	and	I’m	suddenly	sorry	I	didn’t	do	more
for	him.	I	can	tell	by	his	voice	he’s	as	freaked	out	as	I	am,	just	hiding	it
better.	But	Cooper’s	so	golden,	he	can	handle	anything.	His	girlfriend,
Keely,	 is	 one	 of	 my	 best	 friends,	 and	 the	 kind	 of	 girl	 who	 does
everything	right.	She’ll	know	exactly	how	to	help.	Way	better	than	me.

I	settle	myself	into	Jake’s	car	and	watch	the	town	blur	past	as	he
drives	a	little	too	fast.	I	live	only	a	mile	from	school,	and	the	drive	is
short,	but	I’m	bracing	myself	for	my	mother’s	reaction	because	I’m


positive	 she’ll	 have	 heard.	 Her	 communication	 channels	 are
mysterious	but	foolproof,	and	sure	enough	she’s	standing	on	our	front
porch	as	Jake	pulls	into	the	driveway.	I	can	read	her	mood	even	though
the	Botox	froze	her	expressions	long	ago.

I	wait	until	Jake	opens	my	door	to	climb	out	of	the	car,	fitting
myself	under	his	arm	like	always.	My	older	sister,	Ashton,	likes	to	joke
that	I’m	one	of	those	barnacles	that	would	die	without	its	host.	It’s	not
actually	so	funny.

“Adelaide!”	My	mother’s	concern	is	theatrical.	She	stretches	out	a
hand	as	we	make	our	way	up	the	steps	and	strokes	my	free	arm.	“Tell
me	what	happened.”

I	don’t	want	to.	Especially	not	with	Mom’s	boyfriend	lurking	in	the
doorway	behind	her,	pretending	his	curiosity	is	actual	concern.	Justin
is	twelve	years	younger	than	my	mother,	which	makes	him	five	years
younger	than	her	second	husband,	and	fifteen	years	younger	than	my
dad.	At	the	rate	she’s	going,	she’ll	date	Jake	next.

“It’s	fine,”	I	mutter,	ducking	past	them.	“I’m	fine.”
“Hey,	Mrs.	Calloway,”	Jake	says.	Mom	uses	her	second	husband’s
last	name,	not	my	dad’s.	“I’m	going	to	take	Addy	to	her	room.	The
whole	thing	was	awful.	I	can	tell	you	about	it	after	I	get	her	settled.”	It
always	amazes	me	how	Jake	talks	to	my	mother,	like	they’re	peers.

And	 she	 lets	 him	 get	 away	 with	 it.	 _Likes_ it.	 “Of	 course,”	 she
simpers.

My	mother	thinks	Jake’s	too	good	for	me.	She’s	been	telling	me
that	since	sophomore	year	when	he	got	super	hot	and	I	stayed	the
same.	Mom	used	to	enter	Ashton	and	me	into	beauty	pageants	when
we	were	little,	always	with	the	same	results	for	both	of	us:	second
runner-up.	Homecoming	princess,	not	queen.	Not	bad,	but	not	good
enough	to	attract	and	keep	the	kind	of	man	who	can	take	care	of	you
for	life.

I’m	not	sure	if	that’s	ever	been	stated	as	a	 _goal_ 	or	anything,	but	it’s
what	we’re	supposed	to	do.	My	mother	failed.	Ashton’s	failing	in	her
two-year	marriage	with	a	husband	who’s	dropped	out	of	law	school
and	barely	spends	any	time	with	her.	Something	about	the	Prentiss
girls	doesn’t	stick.

```
“Sorry,”	I	murmur	to	Jake	as	we	head	upstairs.	“I	didn’t	handle
```

this	well.	You	should’ve	seen	Bronwyn	and	Cooper.	They	were	great.
And	Nate—my	God.	I	never	thought	I’d	see	Nate	Macauley	take	charge
that	way.	I	was	the	only	one	who	was	useless.”

“Shhh,	don’t	talk	like	that,”	Jake	says	into	my	hair.	“It’s	not	true.”
He	 says	 it	 with	 a	 note	 of	 finality,	 because	 he	 refuses	 to	 see
anything	but	the	best	in	me.	If	that	ever	changed,	I	honestly	don’t
know	what	I’d	do.

**Nate**

**Monday,	September	24,	4:00	p.m.**

When	Bronwyn	and	I	get	to	the	parking	lot	it’s	nearly	empty,	and	we
hesitate	 once	 we’re	 outside	 the	 door.	 I’ve	 known	 Bronwyn	 since
kindergarten,	 give	 or	 take	 a	 few	 middle-school	 years,	 but	 we	 don’t
exactly	hang	out.	Still,	it’s	not	weird	having	her	next	to	me.	Almost
comfortable	after	that	disaster	upstairs.

She	 looks	 around	 like	 she	 just	 woke	 up.	 “I	 didn’t	 drive,”	 she
mutters.	“I	was	supposed	to	get	a	ride.	To	 _Epoch	Coffee._ ”	Something
about	the	way	she	says	it	sounds	significant,	as	if	there’s	more	to	the
story	she’s	not	sharing.

I	have	business	to	transact,	but	now	probably	isn’t	the	time.	“You
want	a	ride?”

Bronwyn	follows	my	gaze	to	my	motorcycle.	“Seriously?	I	wouldn’t
get	on	that	deathtrap	if	you	paid	me.	Do	you	know	the	fatality	rates?
They’re	no	joke.”	She	looks	ready	to	pull	out	a	spread	sheet	and	show
me.

“Suit	yourself.”	I	should	leave	her	and	go	home,	but	I’m	not	ready
to	face	 _that_ 	yet.	I	lean	against	the	building	and	pull	a	flask	of	Jim	Beam
out	of	my	jacket	pocket,	unscrewing	the	top	and	holding	it	toward
Bronwyn.	“Drink?”

She	 folds	 her	 arms	 tightly	 across	 her	 chest.	 “Are	 you	 kidding?
That’s	 your	 brilliant	 idea	 before	 climbing	 onto	 your	 machine	 of
destruction?	And	on	school	property?”

“You’re	a	lot	of	fun,	you	know	that?”	I	don’t	actually	drink	much;
I’d	grabbed	the	flask	from	my	father	this	morning	and	forgotten	about
it.	But	there’s	something	satisfying	about	annoying	Bronwyn.

```
I’m	about	to	put	it	back	in	my	pocket	when	Bronwyn	furrows	her
```

brow	and	holds	out	her	hand.	“What	the	hell.”	She	slumps	against	the
redbrick	 wall	 beside	 me,	 inching	 down	 until	 she’s	 sitting	 on	 the
ground.	 For	 some	 reason	 I	 flash	 back	 to	 elementary	 school,	 when
Bronwyn	 and	 I	 went	 to	 the	 same	 Catholic	 school.	 Before	 life	 went
completely	to	hell.	All	the	girls	wore	plaid	uniform	skirts,	and	she’s	got
a	 similar	 skirt	 on	 now	 that	 hikes	 up	 her	 thighs	 as	 she	 crosses	 her
ankles.	The	view’s	not	bad.

She	drinks	for	a	surprisingly	long	time.	“What.	Just.	Happened?”
I	 sit	 next	 to	 her	 and	 take	 the	 flask,	 putting	 it	 on	 the	 ground
between	us.	“I	have	no	idea.”

“He	looked	like	he	was	going	to	die.”	Bronwyn’s	hand	shakes	so
hard	 when	 she	 picks	 up	 the	 flask	 again	 that	 it	 clatters	 against	 the
ground.	“Don’t	you	think?”

“Yeah,”	I	say	as	Bronwyn	takes	another	swig	and	makes	a	face.
“Poor	 Cooper,”	 she	 says.	 “He	 sounded	 like	 he	 left	 Ole	 Miss
yesterday.	He	always	gets	that	way	when	he’s	nervous.”

“I	wouldn’t	know.	But	what’s-her-name	was	useless.”
_“Addy.”_ Bronwyn’s	 shoulder	 briefly	 nudges	 mine.	 “You	 should
know	her	name.”

“Why?”	I	can’t	think	of	a	good	reason.	That	girl	and	I	have	barely
crossed	paths	before	today	and	probably	won’t	again.	I’m	pretty	sure
that’s	fine	with	both	of	us.	I	know	her	type.	Not	a	thought	in	her	head
except	her	boyfriend	and	whatever	petty	power	play’s	happening	with
her	friends	this	week.	Hot	enough,	I	guess,	but	other	than	that	she’s
got	nothing	to	offer.

“Because	 we’ve	 all	 been	 through	 a	 huge	 trauma	 together,”
Bronwyn	says,	like	that	settles	things.

“You	have	a	lot	of	rules,	don’t	you?”
I	forgot	how	 _tiring_ 	Bronwyn	is.	Even	in	grade	school,	the	amount
of	crap	she	cared	about	on	a	daily	basis	would	wear	down	a	normal
person.	She	was	always	trying	to	join	things,	or	start	things	for	other
people	to	join.	Then	be	in	charge	of	all	the	things	she	joined	or	started.

She’s	not	boring,	though.	I’ll	give	her	that.
We	sit	in	silence,	watching	the	last	of	the	cars	leave	the	parking
lot,	while	Bronwyn	sips	occasionally	from	the	flask.	When	I	finally	take


it	from	her,	I’m	surprised	at	how	light	it	is.	I	doubt	Bronwyn’s	used	to
hard	liquor.	She	seems	more	a	wine	cooler	girl.	If	that.

I	put	the	flask	back	in	my	pocket	as	she	plucks	lightly	at	my	sleeve.
“You	know,	I	meant	to	tell	you,	back	when	it	happened—I	was	really
sorry	to	hear	about	your	mom,”	she	says	haltingly.	“My	uncle	died	in	a
car	 accident	 too,	 right	 around	 the	 same	 time.	 I	 wanted	 to	 say
something	to	you,	but...you	and	I,	you	know,	we	didn’t	really...”	She
trails	off,	her	hand	still	resting	on	my	arm.

“Talk,”	I	say.	“It’s	fine.	Sorry	about	your	uncle.”
“You	must	miss	her	a	lot.”
I	don’t	want	to	talk	about	my	mother.	“Ambulance	came	pretty
fast	today,	huh?”

Bronwyn	gets	a	little	red	and	pulls	her	hand	back,	but	rolls	with
the	quick-change	conversation.	“How	did	you	know	what	to	do?	For
Simon?”

I	shrug.	“Everybody	knows	he	has	a	peanut	allergy.	That’s	what
you	do.”

“I	didn’t	know	about	the	pen.”	She	snorts	out	a	laugh.	“Cooper
gave	you	an	actual	pen!	Like	you	were	going	to	write	him	a	note	or
something.	Oh	my	God.”	She	bangs	her	head	so	hard	against	the	wall
she	 might’ve	 cracked	 something.	 “I	 should	 go	 home.	 This	 is
unproductive	at	best.”

“Offer	of	a	ride	stands.”
I	don’t	expect	her	to	take	it,	but	she	says	“Sure,	why	not”	and	holds
out	her	hand.	She	stumbles	a	little	as	I	help	her	up.	I	didn’t	think
alcohol	 could	 kick	 in	 after	 fifteen	 minutes,	 but	 I	 might’ve
underestimated	the	Bronwyn	Rojas	lightweight	factor.	Probably	should
have	taken	the	flask	away	sooner.

“Where	do	you	live?”	I	ask,	straddling	the	seat	and	fitting	the	key
in	the	ignition.

“Thorndike	Street.	A	couple	miles	from	here.	Past	the	center	of
town,	turn	left	onto	Stone	Valley	Terrace	after	Starbucks.”	The	rich
part	of	town.	Of	course.

I	don’t	usually	take	anybody	on	my	bike	and	don’t	have	a	second
helmet,	so	I	give	her	mine.	She	takes	it	and	I	have	to	will	myself	to	pull


my	eyes	away	from	the	bare	skin	of	her	thigh	as	she	hops	on	behind
me,	tucking	her	skirt	between	her	legs.	She	clamps	her	arms	around
my	waist	too	tightly,	but	I	don’t	say	anything.

“Go	slow,	okay?”	she	asks	nervously	as	I	start	the	engine.	I’d	like
to	irritate	her	more,	but	I	leave	the	parking	lot	at	half	my	normal
speed.	And	though	I	didn’t	think	it	was	possible,	she	squeezes	me	even
tighter.	We	ride	like	that,	her	helmeted	head	pressed	up	against	my
back,	and	I’d	bet	a	thousand	dollars,	if	I	had	it,	that	her	eyes	are	shut
tight	until	we	reach	her	driveway.

Her	house	is	about	what	you’d	expect—a	huge	Victorian	with	a	big
lawn	and	lots	of	complicated	trees	and	flowers.	There’s	a	Volvo	SUV	in
the	driveway,	and	my	bike—which	you	could	call	a	classic	if	you	were
feeling	generous—looks	as	ridiculous	next	to	it	as	Bronwyn	must	look
behind	me.	Talk	about	things	that	don’t	go	together.

Bronwyn	climbs	off	and	fumbles	at	the	helmet.	I	unhook	it	and
help	her	pull	it	off,	loosening	a	strand	of	hair	that	catches	on	the	strap.
She	takes	a	deep	breath	and	straightens	her	skirt.

“That	 was	 terrifying,”	 she	 says,	 then	 jumps	 as	 a	 phone	 rings.
“Where’s	my	backpack?”

“Your	back.”
She	 shrugs	 it	 off	 and	 yanks	 her	 phone	 from	 the	 front	 pocket.
“Hello?	Yes,	I	can....Yes,	this	is	Bronwyn.	Did	you—	Oh	God.	Are	you
sure?”	Her	backpack	slips	out	of	her	hand	and	falls	at	her	feet.	“Thank
you	for	calling.”	She	lowers	the	phone	and	stares	at	me,	her	eyes	wide
and	glassy.

```
“Nate,	he’s	gone,”	she	says.	“Simon’s	dead.”
```

**Bronwyn**

**Tuesday,	September	25,	8:50	a.m.**

I	can’t	stop	doing	the	math	in	my	head.	It’s	eight-fifty	a.m.	on	Tuesday,
and	twenty-four	hours	ago	Simon	was	going	to	homeroom	for	the	last
time.	 Six	 hours	 and	 five	 minutes	 from	 then	 we	 were	 heading	 to
detention.	An	hour	later,	he	died.

Seventeen	years,	gone	just	like	that.
I	 slide	 down	 into	 my	 chair	 in	 the	 back	 corner	 of	 homeroom,
feeling	twenty-five	heads	swivel	my	way	as	I	sit.	Even	without	About
That	to	provide	an	update,	news	of	Simon’s	death	was	everywhere	by
dinnertime	last	night.	I	got	multiple	texts	from	everyone	I’ve	ever	given
my	phone	number	to.

“You	all	right?”	My	friend	Yumiko	reaches	over	and	squeezes	my
hand.	I	nod,	but	the	gesture	makes	the	pounding	in	my	head	even
worse.	Turns	out	half	a	flask	of	bourbon	on	an	empty	stomach	is	a
_terrible_ 	idea.	Luckily	both	my	parents	were	still	at	work	when	Nate
dropped	me	off,	and	my	sister,	Maeve,	poured	enough	black	coffee
down	my	throat	that	I	was	semicoherent	by	the	time	they	got	home.
Any	lingering	effects	they	chalked	up	to	trauma.

The	first	bell	rings,	but	the	speaker	crackle	that	usually	signals
morning	 announcements	 never	 comes.	 Instead,	 our	 homeroom
teacher,	Mrs.	Park,	clears	her	throat	and	gets	up	from	behind	her	desk.
She’s	clutching	a	sheet	of	paper	that	trembles	in	her	hand	as	she	starts
to	 read.	 “The	 following	 is	 an	 official	 announcement	 from	 Bayview
High’s	administration.	I’m	so	sorry	to	have	to	share	this	terrible	news.
Yesterday	afternoon	one	of	your	classmates,	Simon	Kelleher,	suffered	a
massive	 allergic	 reaction.	 Medical	 help	 was	 called	 immediately	 and
arrived	quickly,	but	unfortunately,	it	was	too	late	to	help	Simon.	He
died	at	the	hospital	shortly	after	arrival.”

```
A	low	whispering	buzz	runs	through	the	room	as	somebody	chokes
```

out	a	sob.	Half	the	class	already	has	their	phones	out.	Rules	be	damned
today,	I	guess.	Before	I	can	stop	myself,	I	pull	my	phone	from	my
backpack	and	swipe	to	About	That.	I	half	expect	a	notification	for	the
juicy	new	update	Simon	bragged	about	before	detention	yesterday,	but
of	course	there’s	nothing	except	last	week’s	news.

```
Our	favorite	stoner	drummer’s	trying	his	hand	at	film.	RC’s	installed	a	camera
in	the	light	fixture	in	his	bedroom,	and	he’s	been	holding	premieres	for	all
his	friends.	You’ve	been	warned,	girls.	(Too	late	for	KL,	though.)
Everyone’s	seen	the	flirting	between	manic	pixie	dream	girl	TC	and	new
rich	boy	GR,	but	who	knew	it	might	be	something	more?	Apparently	not	her
boyfriend,	who	sat	oblivious	in	the	bleachers	at	Saturday’s	game	while	T&G	got
hot	and	heavy	right	underneath	him.	Sorry,	JD.	Always	the	last	to	know.

The	thing	with	About	That	was...you	could	pretty	much	guarantee
every	word	was	true.	Simon	built	it	sophomore	year,	after	he	spent
spring	break	at	some	expensive	coding	camp	in	Silicon	Valley,	and
nobody	except	him	was	allowed	to	post	there.	He	had	sources	all	over
school,	and	he	was	choosy	and	careful	about	what	he	reported.	People
usually	denied	it	or	ignored	it,	but	he	was	never	wrong.

I’d	never	been	featured;	I’m	too	squeaky-clean	for	that.	There’s
only	one	thing	Simon	might	have	written	about	me,	but	it	would	have
been	almost	impossible	for	him	to	find	out.

Now	I	guess	he	never	will.
Mrs.	Park	is	still	talking.	“There	will	be	grief	counseling	provided
in	the	auditorium	all	day.	You	may	leave	class	any	time	you	feel	the
need	to	speak	with	someone	about	this	tragedy.	The	school	is	planning
a	memorial	service	for	Simon	after	Saturday’s	football	game,	and	we’ll
provide	those	details	as	soon	as	they’re	available.	We’ll	also	be	sure	to
keep	you	up	to	date	on	his	family’s	arrangements	once	we	know	them.”

The	bell	rings	and	we	all	get	up	to	leave,	but	Mrs.	Park	calls	my
name	before	I’ve	even	collected	my	backpack.	“Bronwyn,	can	you	hold
back	a	moment?”

Yumiko	shoots	me	a	sympathetic	look	as	she	stands,	tucking	a
strand	of	her	choppy	black	hair	behind	her	ear.	“Kate	and	I’ll	wait	for
you	in	the	hallway,	okay?”

I	 nod	 and	 grab	 my	 bag.	 Mrs.	 Park	 is	 still	 dangling	 the
announcement	 from	 one	 hand	 as	 I	 approach	 her	 desk.	 “Bronwyn,
Principal	Gupta	wants	all	of	you	who	were	in	the	room	with	Simon	to


receive	one-on-one	counseling	today.	She’s	asked	me	to	let	you	know
that	you’re	scheduled	for	eleven	o’clock	in	Mr.	O’Farrell’s	office.”

Mr.	O’Farrell	is	my	guidance	counselor,	and	I’m	very	familiar	with
his	 office.	 I’ve	 spent	 a	 lot	 of	 time	 there	 over	 the	 past	 six	 months,
strategizing	 college	 admissions.	 “Is	 Mr.	 O’Farrell	 doing	 the
counseling?”	I	ask.	I	guess	that	wouldn’t	be	so	bad.

Mrs.	Park’s	forehead	creases.	“Oh,	no.	The	school’s	bringing	in	a
professional.”

Great.	I’d	spent	half	the	night	trying	to	convince	my	parents	I
didn’t	need	to	see	anybody.	They’ll	be	thrilled	it	was	forced	on	me
anyway.	“Okay,”	I	say,	and	wait	in	case	she	has	anything	else	to	tell	me,
but	she	just	pats	my	arm	awkwardly.

As	 promised,	 Kate	 and	 Yumiko	 are	 hovering	 outside	 the	 door.
They	flank	me	as	we	walk	to	first-period	calculus,	like	they’re	shielding
me	from	intrusive	paparazzi.	Yumiko	steps	aside,	though,	when	she
sees	Evan	Neiman	waiting	outside	our	classroom	door.

“Bronwyn,	hey.”	Evan’s	wearing	one	of	his	usual	monogrammed
polo	shirts	with	EWN	embroidered	in	script	above	his	heart.	I’ve	always
wondered	what	the	 _W_ 	stands	for.	Walter?	Wendell?	William?	I	hope
for	his	sake	it’s	William.	“Did	you	get	my	text	last	night?”

I	did.	 _Need	anything?	Want	some	company?_ 	Since	that’s	the	only
time	Evan	Neiman	has	ever	texted	me,	my	cynical	side	decided	he	was
angling	 for	 a	 front-row	 seat	 to	 the	 most	 shocking	 thing	 that’s	 ever
happened	at	Bayview.	“I	did,	thanks.	I	was	really	tired,	though.”

“Well,	if	you	ever	feel	like	talking,	let	me	know.”	Evan	glances
around	 the	 emptying	 hallway.	 He’s	 a	 stickler	 for	 punctuality.	 “We
should	probably	get	inside,	huh?”

Yumiko	grins	at	me	as	we	take	our	seats	and	whispers,	“Evan	kept
asking	where	you	were	at	Mathlete	practice	yesterday.”

I	wish	I	could	match	her	enthusiasm,	but	at	some	point	between
detention	and	calculus	I	lost	all	interest	in	Evan	Neiman.	Maybe	it’s
posttraumatic	stress	from	the	Simon	situation,	but	right	now	I	can’t
remember	what	attracted	me	in	the	first	place.	Not	that	I	was	ever
head	over	heels.	Mostly	I	thought	Evan	and	I	had	potential	to	be	a	solid
couple	until	graduation,	at	which	point	we’d	break	up	amicably	and
head	to	our	different	colleges.	Which	I	realize	is	pretty	uninspiring,	but


so	is	high	school	dating.	For	me,	anyway.

I	sit	through	calculus,	my	mind	far,	far	away	from	math,	and	then
suddenly	 it’s	 over	 and	 I’m	 walking	 to	 AP	 English	 with	 Kate	 and
Yumiko.	My	head’s	still	so	full	of	what	happened	yesterday	that	when
we	pass	Nate	in	the	hallway	it	seems	perfectly	natural	to	call	out,	“Hi,
Nate.”	I	stop,	surprising	us	both,	and	he	does	too.

“Hey,”	he	replies.	His	dark	hair	is	more	disheveled	than	ever,	and
I’m	pretty	sure	he’s	wearing	the	same	T-shirt	as	yesterday.	Somehow,
though,	it	works	on	him.	A	little	too	well.	Everything	from	his	tall,
rangy	build	to	his	angular	cheekbones	and	wide-set,	dark-fringed	eyes
is	making	me	lose	my	train	of	thought.

Kate	and	Yumiko	are	staring	at	him	too,	but	in	a	different	way.
More	like	he’s	an	unpredictable	zoo	animal	in	a	flimsy	cage.	Hallway
conversations	with	Nate	Macauley	aren’t	exactly	part	of	our	routine.
“Have	you	had	your	counseling	session	yet?”	I	ask.

His	face	is	a	total	blank.	“My	what?”
“Grief	 counseling.	 Because	 of	 Simon.	 Didn’t	 your	 homeroom
teacher	tell	you?”

“I	just	got	here,”	he	says,	and	my	eyes	widen.	I	never	expected
Nate	to	win	any	attendance	awards,	but	it’s	almost	ten	o’clock.

“Oh.	Well,	all	of	us	who	were	there	are	supposed	to	have	one-on-
one	sessions.	Mine’s	at	eleven.”

“Jesus	Christ,”	Nate	mutters,	raking	a	hand	through	his	hair.
The	gesture	pulls	my	eyes	to	his	arm,	where	they	remain	until	Kate
clears	her	throat.	My	face	heats	as	I	snap	back	to	attention,	too	late	to
register	whatever	she	said.	“Anyway.	See	you	around,”	I	mumble.

Yumiko	 bends	 her	 head	 toward	 mine	 as	 soon	 as	 we’re	 out	 of
earshot.	“He	looks	like	he	just	rolled	out	of	bed,”	she	whispers.	“And
_not	alone._ ”

“I	 hope	 you	 doused	 yourself	 in	 Lysol	 after	 getting	 off	 his
motorcycle,”	Kate	adds.	“He’s	a	total	man-whore.”

I	glare	at	her.	“You	realize	it’s	sexist	to	say	 _man_ -whore,	right?	If
you	have	to	use	the	term	you	should	at	least	be	gender-neutral	about
it.”

```
“Whatever,”	Kate	says	dismissively.	“Point	is,	he’s	a	walking	STD.”
```

I	don’t	answer.	That’s	Nate’s	reputation,	sure,	but	we	don’t	really
know	anything	about	him.	I	almost	tell	her	how	carefully	he	drove	me
home	yesterday,	except	I’m	not	sure	what	point	I’d	be	trying	to	make.

After	English	I	head	for	Mr.	O’Farrell’s	office,	and	he	waves	me
inside	when	I	knock	on	his	open	door.	“Have	a	seat,	Bronwyn.	Dr.
Resnick	is	running	a	little	late,	but	she’ll	be	here	shortly.”	I	sit	down
across	from	him	and	spy	my	name	scrawled	across	the	manila	folder
placed	neatly	in	the	middle	of	his	desk.	I	move	to	pick	it	up,	then
hesitate,	not	sure	if	it’s	confidential,	but	he	pushes	it	toward	me.	“Your
recommendation	from	the	Model	UN	organizer.	In	plenty	of	time	for
Yale’s	early-action	deadline.”

I	exhale,	letting	out	a	small	sigh	of	relief.	“Oh,	thanks!”	I	say,	and
pick	up	the	folder.	It’s	the	last	one	I’ve	been	waiting	for.	Yale’s	a	family
tradition—my	grandfather	was	a	visiting	scholar	there	and	moved	his
whole	family	from	Colombia	to	New	Haven	when	he	got	tenure.	All	his
kids,	including	my	dad,	went	to	undergrad	there,	and	it’s	where	my
parents	met.	They	always	say	our	family	wouldn’t	exist	if	it	weren’t	for
Yale.

“You’re	very	welcome.”	Mr.	O’Farrell	leans	back	and	adjusts	his
glasses.	“Were	your	ears	burning	earlier?	Mr.	Camino	stopped	by	to
ask	if	you’d	be	interested	in	tutoring	for	chemistry	this	semester.	A
bunch	of	bright	juniors	are	struggling	the	way	you	did	last	year.	They’d
love	to	learn	strategies	from	someone	who	ended	up	acing	the	course.”

I	have	to	swallow	a	couple	of	times	before	I	can	answer.	“I	would,”
I	say,	as	brightly	as	I	can	manage,	“but	I	might	be	overcommitted
already.”	My	smile	stretches	too	tightly	over	my	teeth.

“No	worries.	You	have	a	lot	on	your	plate.”
Chemistry	was	the	only	class	I’d	ever	struggled	with,	so	much	so
that	I	had	a	D	average	at	midterm.	With	every	quiz	I	bombed,	I	could
feel	the	Ivy	League	slipping	out	of	reach.	Even	Mr.	O’Farrell	started
gently	suggesting	that	any	top-tier	school	would	do.

So	I	brought	my	grades	up,	and	got	an	A	by	the	end	of	the	year.
But	I’m	pretty	sure	nobody	wants	me	sharing	my	strategies	with	the
other	students.

**Cooper**

**Thursday,	September	27,	12:45	p.m.**


“Will	I	see	you	tonight?”

Keely	takes	my	hand	as	we	walk	to	our	lockers	after	lunch,	looking
up	at	me	with	huge	dark	eyes.	Her	mom	is	Swedish	and	her	dad’s
Filipino,	and	the	combination	makes	Keely	the	most	beautiful	girl	in
school	by	a	lot.	I	haven’t	seen	her	much	this	week	between	baseball
and	family	stuff,	and	I	can	tell	she’s	getting	antsy.	Keely’s	not	a	clinger,
exactly,	but	she	needs	regular	couple	time.

“Not	sure,”	I	say.	“I’m	pretty	behind	on	homework.”
Her	perfect	lips	curve	down	and	I	can	tell	she’s	about	to	protest
when	a	voice	floats	over	the	loudspeaker.	 _“Attention,	please.	Would
Cooper	Clay,	Nate	Macauley,	Adelaide	Prentiss,	and	Bronwyn	Rojas
please	 report	 to	 the	 main	 office.	 Cooper	 Clay,	 Nate	 Macauley,
Adelaide	Prentiss,	and	Bronwyn	Rojas	to	the	main	office.”_

Keely	looks	around	like	she’s	expecting	an	explanation.	“What’s
that	about?	Something	to	do	with	Simon?”

“I	guess.”	I	shrug.	I	already	answered	questions	from	Principal
Gupta	a	couple	of	days	ago	about	what	happened	during	detention,	but
maybe	she’s	gearing	up	for	another	round.	My	father	says	Simon’s
parents	are	pretty	connected	around	town,	and	the	school	should	be
worried	about	a	lawsuit	if	it	turns	out	they	were	negligent	in	any	way.
“Better	go.	I’ll	talk	to	you	later,	okay?”	I	give	Keely	a	quick	kiss	on	the
cheek,	shoulder	my	backpack,	and	head	down	the	hall.

When	I	get	to	the	principal’s	office,	the	receptionist	points	me
toward	a	small	conference	room	that’s	already	crowded	with	people:
Principal	Gupta,	Addy,	Bronwyn,	Nate,	and	a	police	officer.	My	throat
gets	a	little	dry	as	I	take	the	last	empty	chair.

“Cooper,	good.	Now	we	can	get	started.”	Principal	Gupta	folds	her
hands	in	front	of	her	and	looks	around	the	table.	“I’d	like	to	introduce
Officer	Hank	Budapest	with	the	Bayview	Police	Department.	He	has
some	questions	about	what	you	witnessed	on	Monday.”

Officer	Budapest	shakes	each	of	our	hands	in	turn.	He’s	young	but
already	balding,	with	sandy	hair	and	freckles.	Not	very	intimidating,
authority-wise.	“Nice	to	meet	you	all.	This	shouldn’t	take	long,	but
after	speaking	with	the	Kelleher	family	we	want	to	take	a	closer	look	at
Simon’s	death.	Autopsy	results	came	back	this	morning,	and—”

```
“Already?”	 Bronwyn	 interrupts,	 earning	 a	 look	 from	 Principal
```

Gupta	that	she	doesn’t	notice.	“Don’t	those	usually	take	longer?”

“Preliminary	results	can	be	available	within	a	couple	days,”	Officer
Budapest	says.	“These	were	fairly	conclusive,	showing	that	Simon	died
from	a	large	dose	of	peanut	oil	ingested	shortly	before	death.	Which
his	parents	found	strange,	considering	how	careful	he	always	was	with
his	food	and	drink.	All	of	you	told	Principal	Gupta	that	Simon	drank	a
cup	of	water	just	before	he	collapsed,	is	that	right?”

We	all	nod,	and	Officer	Budapest	continues,	“The	cup	contained
traces	of	peanut	oil,	so	it	seems	clear	Simon	died	from	that	drink.	What
we’re	trying	to	figure	out	now	is	how	peanut	oil	could	have	gotten	into
his	cup.”

Nobody	speaks.	Addy	meets	my	eyes	and	then	cuts	hers	away,	a
small	 frown	 creasing	 her	 forehead.	 “Does	 anyone	 remember	 where
Simon	got	the	cup	from?”	Officer	Budapest	prompts,	poising	his	pen
over	a	blank	notebook	in	front	of	him.

“I	 wasn’t	 paying	 attention,”	 Bronwyn	 says.	 “I	 was	 writing	 my
assignment.”

“Me	too,”	Addy	says,	although	I	could’ve	sworn	she	hadn’t	even
started.	Nate	stretches	and	stares	at	the	ceiling.

“I	remember,”	I	volunteer.	“He	got	the	cup	from	a	stack	next	to	the
sink.”

“Was	the	stack	upside	down,	or	right-side	up?”
“Upside	down,”	I	say.	“Simon	pulled	the	top	one	off.”
“Did	you	notice	any	liquid	leave	the	cup	when	he	did	that?	Did	he
shake	it?”

I	think	back.	“No.	He	just	filled	it	with	water.”
“And	then	he	drank	it?”
“Yeah,”	I	say,	but	Bronwyn	corrects	me.
“No,”	 she	 says.	 “Not	 right	 away.	 He	 talked	 for	 a	 while.
Remember?”	 She	 turns	 to	 Nate.	 “He	 asked	 you	 if	 you	 put	 the	 cell
phones	in	our	backpacks.	The	ones	that	got	us	in	trouble	with	Mr.
Avery.”

“The	cell	phones.	Right.”	Officer	Budapest	scratches	something
down	in	his	notebook.	He	doesn’t	say	it	like	a	question,	but	Bronwyn


explains	anyway.

“Somebody	played	a	prank	on	us,”	she	says.	“It’s	why	we	were	in
detention.	Mr.	Avery	found	phones	in	our	backpacks	that	didn’t	belong
to	us.”	She	turns	to	Principal	Gupta	with	an	injured	expression.	“It
really	wasn’t	fair.	I’ve	been	meaning	to	ask,	is	that	something	that	goes
on	your	permanent	record?”

Nate	rolls	his	eyes.	“It	wasn’t	me.	Someone	stuck	a	phone	in	my
backpack	too.”

Principal	Gupta	furrows	her	brow.	“This	is	the	first	I’m	hearing
about	this.”

I	shrug	when	she	meets	my	eyes.	Those	phones	were	the	last	thing
on	my	mind	these	past	few	days.

Officer	Budapest	doesn’t	look	surprised.	“Mr.	Avery	mentioned
that	when	I	met	with	him	earlier.	He	said	none	of	the	kids	ever	claimed
the	phones,	so	he	thought	it	must’ve	been	a	prank	after	all.”	He	slides
his	pen	between	his	index	and	middle	finger	and	taps	it	rhythmically
against	the	table.	“Is	that	the	sort	of	joke	Simon	might	have	played	on
you	all?”

“I	don’t	see	why,”	Addy	says.	“There	was	a	phone	in	his	backpack
too.	Besides,	I	barely	knew	him.”

“You	were	on	junior	prom	court	with	him,”	Bronwyn	points	out.
Addy	blinks,	like	she’s	only	just	remembering	that’s	true.

“Any	of	you	kids	ever	have	trouble	with	Simon?”	Officer	Budapest
asks.	“I’ve	heard	about	the	app	he	made—About	That,	right?”	He’s
looking	at	me,	so	I	nod.	“You	guys	ever	been	on	it?”

Everyone	shakes	their	head	except	Nate.	“Lots	of	times,”	he	says.
“What	for?”	Officer	Budapest	asks.
Nate	smirks.	“Stupid	shit—”	he	starts,	but	Principal	Gupta	cuts
him	off.

“Language,	Mr.	Macauley.”
“Stupid	stuff,”	Nate	amends.	“Hooking	up,	mostly.”
“Did	that	bother	you?	Being	gossiped	about?”
“Not	really.”	He	looks	like	he	means	it.	I	guess	being	on	a	gossip
app	isn’t	a	big	deal	compared	to	getting	arrested.	If	that’s	true.	Simon


never	posted	it,	so	nobody	seems	to	know	exactly	what	Nate’s	deal	is.

Kinda	pathetic,	how	Simon	was	our	most	trusted	news	source.
Officer	Budapest	looks	at	the	rest	of	us.	“But	not	you	three?”	We
all	shake	our	heads	again.	“Did	you	ever	worry	about	ending	up	on
Simon’s	app?	Feel	like	you	had	something	hanging	over	your	heads,	or
anything	like	that?”

“Not	me,”	I	say,	but	my	voice	isn’t	as	confident	as	I	would	have
liked.	 I	 glance	 away	 from	 Officer	 Budapest	 and	 catch	 Addy	 and
Bronwyn	looking	like	polar	opposites:	Addy’s	gone	pale	as	a	ghost,	and
Bronwyn’s	flushed	brick	red.	Nate	watches	them	for	a	few	seconds,	tilts
his	chair	back,	and	looks	at	Officer	Budapest.

```
“Everybody’s	got	secrets,”	he	says.	“Right?”
—
```
My	workout	routine	goes	long	that	night,	but	my	dad	makes	everyone
wait	till	I’m	done	so	we	can	eat	dinner	together.	My	brother,	Lucas,
clutches	his	stomach	and	staggers	to	the	table	with	a	long-suffering
look	when	we	finally	sit	down	at	seven.

The	topic	of	conversation’s	the	same	as	it’s	been	all	week:	Simon.
“You	had	to	figure	the	police’d	get	involved	at	some	point,”	Pop	says,
spooning	 a	 small	 mountain	 of	 mashed	 potatoes	 onto	 his	 plate.
“Something’s	not	right	about	how	that	boy	died.”	He	snorts.	“Peanut
oil	in	the	water	system,	maybe?	Lawyers	are	gonna	have	a	field	day
with	that.”

“Were	 his	 eyes	 bugging	 out	 of	 his	 head	 like	 _this_ ?”	asks	Lucas,
making	a	face.	He’s	twelve,	and	Simon’s	death	is	nothing	but	video-
game	gore	to	him.

My	grandmother	reaches	over	and	swats	Lucas	on	the	back	of	his
hand.	Nonny’s	barely	five	feet	tall	with	a	head	full	of	tight	white	curls,
but	she	means	business.	“Hush	your	mouth	unless	you	can	speak	of
that	poor	young	man	with	respect.”

Nonny’s	lived	with	us	since	we	moved	here	from	Mississippi	five
years	ago.	It	surprised	me	then	that	she	came	along;	our	grandfather
had	been	dead	for	years,	but	she	had	plenty	of	friends	and	clubs	that
kept	her	busy.	Now	that	we’ve	lived	here	for	a	while,	I	get	it.	Our	basic
colonial	 costs	 three	 times	 what	 our	 house	 in	 Mississippi	 did,	 and
there’s	no	way	we	could	afford	it	without	Nonny’s	money.	But	you	can


play	baseball	year-round	in	Bayview,	and	it’s	got	one	of	the	best	high
school	programs	in	the	country.	At	some	point,	Pop	expects	I’ll	make
this	gigantic	mortgage	and	the	job	he	hates	worthwhile.

I	might.	After	my	fastball	improved	by	five	miles	an	hour	over	the
summer,	I	ended	up	fourth	on	ESPN’s	predictions	for	the	June	MLB
draft	 next	 year.	 I’m	 getting	 scouted	 by	 a	 lot	 of	 colleges	 too,	 and
wouldn’t	 mind	 heading	 there	 first.	 But	 baseball’s	 not	 the	 same	 as
football	or	basketball.	If	a	guy	can	head	for	the	minors	right	out	of	high
school,	he	usually	does.

Pop	 points	 at	 me	 with	 his	 knife.	 “You	 got	 a	 showcase	 game
Saturday.	Don’t	forget.”

As	if	I	could.	The	schedule’s	posted	around	the	whole	house.
“Kevin,	maybe	one	weekend	off?”	my	mother	murmurs,	but	her
heart’s	not	in	it.	She	knows	it’s	a	losing	battle.

“Best	thing	Cooperstown	can	do	is	business	as	usual,”	Pop	says.
“Slacking	off	won’t	bring	that	boy	back.	God	rest	his	soul.”

Nonny’s	small,	bright	eyes	settle	on	me.	“I	hope	you	realize	none
of	you	kids	could’ve	done	anything	for	Simon,	Cooper.	The	police	have
to	dot	their	i’s	and	cross	their	t’s,	that’s	all.”

I	don’t	know	about	that.	Officer	Budapest	kept	asking	me	about
the	missing	EpiPens	and	how	long	I	was	by	myself	in	the	nurse’s	office.
Almost	like	he	thought	I	might’ve	done	something	with	them	before
Ms.	Grayson	got	there.	But	he	didn’t	come	out	and	say	it.	If	he	thinks
someone	messed	with	Simon,	I’m	not	sure	why	he	isn’t	looking	at	Nate.
If	anybody	asked	me—which	they	didn’t—I’d	wonder	how	a	guy	like
Nate	even	knew	about	EpiPens	in	the	first	place.

We’ve	just	finished	clearing	the	table	when	the	doorbell	rings,	and
Lucas	sprints	for	the	door,	hollering,	“I’ll	get	it!”	A	few	seconds	later	he
yells	again.	“It’s	Keely!”

Nonny	rises	to	her	feet	with	difficulty,	using	the	skull-topped	cane
Lucas	 picked	 out	 last	 year	 when	 she	 faced	 up	 to	 the	 fact	 that	 she
couldn’t	walk	on	her	own	anymore.	“Thought	you	said	you	two	didn’t
have	plans	tonight,	Cooper.”

“We	didn’t,”	I	mutter	as	Keely	enters	the	kitchen	with	a	smile,
wrapping	her	arms	around	my	neck	in	a	tight	hug.


“How	are	you?”	she	murmurs	in	my	ear,	her	soft	lips	brushing	my
cheek.	“I’ve	been	thinking	about	you	all	day.”

“Okay,”	I	say.	She	pulls	back	and	reaches	into	her	pocket,	briefly

**Addy**

**Thursday,	September	27,	7:30	p.m.**

I	should	be	doing	homework	before	Jake	stops	by,	but	instead	I’m
sitting	at	the	vanity	in	my	bedroom,	pressing	fingers	to	the	skin	at	my
hairline.	The	tenderness	on	my	left	temple	feels	as	though	it’s	going	to
turn	 into	 one	 of	 those	 horrible	 oversized	 pimples	 I	 get	 every	 few
months	or	so.	Whenever	I	have	one	I	know	it’s	all	anyone	can	see.

I’ll	have	to	wear	my	hair	down	for	a	while,	which	is	how	Jake	likes
it	 anyway.	 My	 hair	 is	 the	 only	 thing	 I	 feel	 one	 hundred	 percent
confident	about	all	the	time.	I	was	at	Glenn’s	Diner	last	week	with	my
girlfriends,	sitting	next	to	Keely	across	from	the	big	mirror,	and	she
reached	over	and	ran	a	hand	through	my	hair	while	grinning	at	our
reflections.	 _Can	we	please	trade?	Just	for	a	week?_ 	she	said.

I	smiled	at	her,	but	wished	I	were	sitting	on	the	other	side	of	the
table.	I	hate	seeing	Keely	and	me	side	by	side.	She’s	so	beautiful,	all
tawny	skin	and	long	eyelashes	and	Angelina	Jolie	lips.	She’s	the	lead
character	in	a	movie	and	I’m	the	generic	best	friend	whose	name	you
forget	before	the	credits	even	start	rolling.

The	doorbell	rings,	but	I	know	better	than	to	expect	Jake	upstairs
right	away.	Mom’s	going	to	capture	him	for	at	least	ten	minutes.	She
can’t	 hear	 enough	 about	 the	 Simon	 situation,	 and	 she’d	 talk	 about
today’s	meeting	with	Officer	Budapest	all	night	if	I	let	her.

I	separate	my	hair	into	sections	and	run	a	brush	along	each	length.
My	mind	keeps	going	back	to	Simon.	He’d	been	a	constant	presence
around	our	group	since	freshman	year,	but	he	was	never	one	of	us.	He
had	only	one	real	friend,	a	sorta-Goth	girl	named	Janae.	I	used	to	think
they	were	together	until	Simon	started	asking	out	all	my	friends.	Of
course,	 none	 of	 them	 ever	 said	 yes.	 Although	 last	 year,	 before	 she
started	dating	Cooper,	Keely	got	super	drunk	at	a	party	and	let	Simon
kiss	her	for	five	minutes	in	a	closet.	It	took	her	ages	to	shake	him	after


that.

I’m	not	sure	what	Simon	was	thinking,	to	be	honest.	Keely	has	one
type:	jock.	He	should	have	gone	for	someone	like	Bronwyn.	She’s	cute
enough,	in	a	quiet	kind	of	way,	with	interesting	gray	eyes	and	hair	that
would	probably	look	great	if	she	ever	wore	it	down.	Plus	she	and	Simon
must’ve	tripped	over	each	other	in	honors	classes	all	the	time.

Except	I	got	the	impression	today	that	Bronwyn	didn’t	like	Simon
much.	Or	at	all.	When	Officer	Budapest	talked	about	how	Simon	died,
Bronwyn	looked...I	don’t	know.	Not	sad.

A	knock	sounds	at	the	door	and	I	watch	it	open	in	the	mirror.	I
keep	brushing	my	hair	as	Jake	comes	in.	He	pulls	off	his	sneakers	and
flops	 on	 my	 bed	 with	 exaggerated	 exhaustion,	 arms	 splayed	 at	 his
sides.	“Your	mom’s	wrung	me	dry,	Ads.	I’ve	never	met	anyone	who	can
ask	the	same	question	so	many	ways.”

“Tell	me	about	it,”	I	say,	getting	up	to	join	him.	He	puts	an	arm
around	me	and	I	curl	into	his	side,	my	head	on	his	shoulder	and	my
hand	on	his	chest.	We	know	exactly	how	to	fit	together,	and	I	relax	for
the	first	time	since	I	got	called	into	Principal	Gupta’s	office.

I	trail	my	fingers	along	his	bicep.	Jake’s	not	as	defined	as	Cooper,
who’s	practically	a	superhero	with	all	the	professional-level	working
out	he	does,	but	to	me	he’s	the	perfect	balance	of	muscular	and	lean.
And	he’s	fast,	the	best	running	back	Bayview	High’s	seen	in	years.
There’s	not	the	same	feeding	frenzy	around	him	as	Cooper,	but	a	few
colleges	are	interested	and	he’s	got	a	good	shot	at	a	scholarship.

“Mrs.	Kelleher	called	me,”	Jake	says.
My	hand	halts	its	progress	up	his	arm	as	I	stare	at	the	crisp	blue
cotton	of	his	T-shirt.	“Simon’s	mother?	Why?”

“She	 asked	 if	 I’d	 be	 a	 pallbearer	 at	 the	 funeral.	 It’s	 gonna	 be
Sunday,”	Jake	says,	his	shoulders	lifting	in	a	shrug.	“I	told	her	sure.
Can’t	really	say	no,	can	I?”

I	 forget	 sometimes	 that	 Simon	 and	 Jake	 used	 to	 be	 friends	 in
grade	school	and	middle	school,	before	Jake	turned	into	a	jock	and
Simon	turned	into...whatever	he	was.	Freshman	year	Jake	made	the
varsity	football	team	and	started	hanging	out	with	Cooper,	who	was
already	a	Bayview	legend	after	almost	pitching	his	middle	school	team
to	the	Little	League	World	Series.	By	sophomore	year	the	two	of	them


were	basically	the	kings	of	our	class,	and	Simon	was	just	some	weird
guy	Jake	used	to	know.

I	half	think	Simon	started	About	That	to	impress	Jake.	Simon
found	 out	 one	 of	 Jake’s	 football	 rivals	 was	 behind	 the	 anonymous
sexting	harassment	of	a	bunch	of	junior	girls	and	posted	it	on	this	app
called	After	School.	It	got	tons	of	attention	for	a	couple	of	weeks,	and
so	did	Simon.	That	might’ve	been	the	first	time	anyone	at	Bayview
noticed	him.

Jake	probably	patted	him	on	the	back	once	and	forgot	about	it,
and	Simon	moved	on	to	bigger	and	better	things	by	building	his	own
app.	Gossip	as	a	public	service	doesn’t	go	very	far,	so	Simon	started
posting	things	a	lot	pettier	and	more	personal	than	the	sexting	scandal.
Nobody	thought	he	was	a	hero	anymore,	but	by	then	they	were	getting
scared	of	him,	and	I	guess	for	Simon	that	was	almost	as	good.

Jake	usually	defended	Simon,	though,	when	our	friends	got	down
on	him	for	About	That.	 _It’s	not	like	he’s	lying,_ 	he’d	point	out.	 _Stop
doing	sneaky	shit	and	it	won’t	be	a	problem._

Jake	 can	 be	 pretty	 black-and-white	 in	 his	 thinking	 sometimes.
Easy	when	you	never	make	a	mistake.

“We’re	still	headed	for	the	beach	tomorrow	night,	if	that’s	okay,”
he	tells	me	now,	winding	my	hair	around	his	fingers.	He	says	it	like	it’s
up	to	me,	but	we	both	know	Jake’s	in	charge	of	our	social	life.

“Of	course,”	I	murmur.	“Who’s	going?”	 _Don’t	say	TJ._
“Cooper	and	Keely	are	supposed	to,	although	she’s	not	sure	he’s
up	for	it.	Luis	and	Olivia.	Vanessa,	Tyler,	Noah,	Sarah...”

_Don’t	say	TJ._
“...and	TJ.”
_Argh._ 	I’m	not	sure	if	it’s	my	imagination	or	if	TJ,	who	used	to	be
on	the	outskirts	of	our	group	as	the	new	kid,	has	started	working	his
way	 into	 the	 center	 right	 when	 I	 wish	 he’d	 disappear	 altogether.
“Great,”	I	say	blandly,	reaching	up	and	kissing	Jake’s	jawline.	It’s	the
time	of	day	when	it’s	a	little	scratchy,	which	is	new	this	year.

“Adelaide!”	My	mother’s	voice	floats	up	the	stairs.	“We’re	heading
out.”	 She	 and	 Justin	 go	 somewhere	 downtown	 almost	 every	 night,
usually	restaurants	but	sometimes	clubs.	Justin’s	only	thirty	and	still


into	that	whole	scene.	My	mother	enjoys	it	almost	as	much,	especially
when	people	mistake	her	for	being	Justin’s	age.

“Okay!”	I	call,	and	the	door	slams.	After	a	minute	Jake	leans	down
to	kiss	me,	his	hand	sliding	under	my	shirt.

A	lot	of	people	think	Jake	and	I	have	been	sleeping	together	since
freshman	year,	but	that’s	not	true.	He	wanted	to	wait	until	after	junior
prom.	It	was	a	big	deal;	Jake	rented	a	fancy	hotel	room	that	he	filled
with	 candles	 and	 flowers,	 and	 bought	 me	 amazing	 lingerie	 from
Victoria’s	 Secret.	 I	 wouldn’t	 have	 minded	 something	 a	 little	 more
spontaneous,	I	guess,	but	I	know	I’m	beyond	lucky	to	have	a	boyfriend
who	cares	enough	to	plan	every	last	detail.

“Is	this	okay?”	Jake’s	eyes	scan	my	face.	“Or	would	you	rather	just
hang	out?”	His	brows	rise	like	it’s	a	real	question,	but	his	hand	keeps
inching	lower.

I	never	turn	Jake	down.	It’s	like	my	mother	said	when	she	first
took	 me	 to	 get	 birth	 control:	 if	 you	 say	 no	 too	 much,	 pretty	 soon
someone	else	will	say	yes.	Anyway,	I	want	it	as	much	as	he	does.	I	live
for	these	moments	of	closeness	with	Jake;	I’d	crawl	inside	him	if	I
could.

```
“More	than	okay,”	I	say,	and	pull	him	on	top	of	me.
```
**Nate**

**Thursday,	September	27,	8:00	p.m.**

I	live	in	 _that_ 	house.	The	one	people	drive	past	and	say,	 _I	can’t	believe
someone	 actually	 lives	 there_ .	 We	 do,	 although	 “living”	 might	 be	 a
stretch.	I’m	gone	as	much	as	possible	and	my	dad’s	half-dead.

Our	house	is	on	the	far	edge	of	Bayview,	the	kind	of	shitty	ranch
rich	people	buy	to	tear	down.	Small	and	ugly,	with	only	one	window	in
front.	The	chimney’s	been	crumbling	since	I	was	ten.	Seven	years	later
everything	else	is	joining	it:	the	paint’s	peeling,	shutters	are	hanging
off,	the	concrete	steps	in	front	are	cracked	wide	open.	The	yard’s	just
as	bad.	The	grass	is	almost	knee-high	and	yellow	after	the	summer
drought.	I	used	to	mow	it,	sometimes,	until	it	hit	me	that	yard	work	is
a	waste	of	time	that	never	ends.

My	father’s	passed	out	on	the	couch	when	I	get	inside,	an	empty
bottle	of	Seagram’s	in	front	of	him.	Dad	considers	it	a	stroke	of	luck
that	he	fell	off	a	ladder	during	a	roofing	job	a	few	years	ago,	while	he


was	still	a	functioning	alcoholic.	He	got	a	workman’s	comp	settlement
and	wound	up	disabled	enough	to	collect	social	security,	which	is	like
winning	 the	 lottery	 for	 a	 guy	 like	 him.	 Now	 he	 can	 drink	 without
interruption	while	the	checks	roll	in.

The	money’s	not	much,	though.	I	like	having	cable,	keeping	my
bike	on	the	road,	and	occasionally	eating	more	than	mac	and	cheese.
Which	is	how	I	came	to	my	part-time	job,	and	why	I	spent	four	hours
after	school	today	distributing	plastic	bags	full	of	painkillers	around
San	 Diego	 County.	 Obviously	 not	 something	 I	 should	 be	 doing,
especially	since	I	was	picked	up	for	dealing	weed	over	the	summer	and
I’m	 on	 probation.	 But	 nothing	 else	 pays	 as	 well	 and	 takes	 so	 little
effort.

I	head	for	the	kitchen,	open	the	refrigerator	door,	and	pull	out
some	 leftover	 Chinese.	 There’s	 a	 picture	 curling	 under	 a	 magnet,
cracked	like	a	broken	window.	My	dad,	my	mother,	and	me	when	I	was
eleven,	right	before	she	took	off.

She	was	bipolar	and	not	great	about	taking	her	meds,	so	it’s	not	as
though	 I	 had	 some	 fantastic	 childhood	 while	 she	 was	 around.	 My
earliest	memory	is	her	dropping	a	plate,	then	sitting	on	the	floor	in	the
middle	of	the	pieces,	crying	her	eyes	out.	Once	I	got	off	the	bus	to	her
throwing	all	our	stuff	out	the	window.	Lots	of	times	she’d	curl	up	in	a
corner	of	her	bed	and	not	move	for	days.

Her	manic	phases	were	a	trip,	though.	For	my	eighth	birthday	she
took	me	to	a	department	store,	handed	me	a	cart,	and	told	me	to	fill	it
with	 whatever	 I	 wanted.	 When	 I	 was	 nine	 and	 into	 reptiles	 she
surprised	 me	 by	 setting	 up	 a	 terrarium	 in	 the	 living	 room	 with	 a
bearded	dragon.	We	called	it	Stan	after	Stan	Lee,	and	I	still	have	it.
Those	things	live	forever.

My	father	didn’t	drink	as	much	then,	so	between	the	two	of	them
they	managed	to	get	me	to	school	and	sports.	Then	my	mother	went
totally	 off	 her	 meds	 and	 started	 getting	 into	 other	 mind-altering
substances.	Yeah,	I’m	the	asshole	who	deals	drugs	after	they	wrecked
his	 mother.	 But	 to	 be	 clear:	 I	 don’t	 sell	 anything	 except	 weed	 and
painkillers.	My	mother	would’ve	been	fine	if	she’d	stayed	away	from
cocaine.

For	a	while	she	came	back	every	few	months	or	so.	Then	once	a
year.	The	last	time	I	saw	her	was	when	I	was	fourteen	and	my	dad


started	falling	apart.	She	kept	talking	about	this	farm	commune	she’d
moved	to	in	Oregon	and	how	great	it	was,	that	she’d	take	me	and	I
could	go	to	school	there	with	all	the	hippie	kids	and	grow	organic
berries	or	whatever	the	hell	they	did.

She	bought	me	a	giant	ice	cream	sundae	at	Glenn’s	Diner,	like	I
was	eight	years	old,	and	told	me	all	about	it.	 _You’ll	love	it,	Nathaniel.
Everyone	is	so	accepting.	Nobody	labels	you	the	way	they	do	here._

It	sounded	like	bullshit	even	then,	but	better	than	Bayview.	So	I
packed	a	bag,	put	Stan	in	his	carrier,	and	waited	for	her	on	our	front
steps.	I	must	have	sat	there	half	the	night,	like	a	complete	fucking
loser,	before	it	finally	dawned	on	me	she	wasn’t	going	to	show.

Turned	out	that	trip	to	Glenn’s	Diner	was	the	last	time	I	ever	saw
her.

While	the	Chinese	heats	up	I	check	on	Stan,	who’s	still	got	a	pile	of
wilted	vegetables	and	a	few	live	crickets	from	this	morning.	I	lift	the
cover	from	his	terrarium	and	he	blinks	up	at	me	from	his	rock.	Stan	is
pretty	 chill	 and	 low	 maintenance,	 which	 is	 the	 only	 reason	 he’s
managed	to	stay	alive	in	this	house	for	eight	years.

“What’s	up,	Stan?”	I	put	him	on	my	shoulder,	grab	my	food,	and
flop	into	an	armchair	across	from	my	comatose	father.	He	has	the
World	Series	on,	which	I	turn	off	because	(a)	I	hate	baseball	and	(b)	it
reminds	me	of	Cooper	Clay,	which	reminds	me	of	Simon	Kelleher	and
that	whole	sick	scene	in	detention.	I’d	never	liked	the	kid,	but	that	was
horrible.	And	Cooper	was	almost	as	useless	as	the	blond	girl	when	you
come	right	down	to	it.	Bronwyn	was	the	only	one	who	did	anything
except	babble	like	an	idiot.

My	 mother	 used	 to	 like	 Bronwyn.	 She’d	 always	 notice	 her	 at
school	 things.	 Like	 the	 Nativity	 play	 in	 fourth	 grade	 when	 I	 was	 a
shepherd	 and	 Bronwyn	 was	 the	 Virgin	 Mary.	 Someone	 stole	 baby
Jesus	 before	 we	 were	 supposed	 to	 go	 on,	 probably	 to	 mess	 with
Bronwyn	 because	 she	 took	 everything	 way	 too	 seriously	 even	 then.
Bronwyn	went	into	the	audience,	borrowed	a	bag,	wrapped	a	blanket
around	it,	and	carried	it	around	as	if	nothing	had	happened.	 _That	girl
doesn’t	take	crap	from	anyone,_ 	my	mother	had	said	approvingly.

Okay.	In	the	interest	of	full	disclosure,	 _I_ 	stole	baby	Jesus,	and	it
was	definitely	to	mess	with	Bronwyn.	It	would’ve	been	funnier	if	she’d
freaked	out.


My	jacket	beeps,	and	I	dig	in	my	pockets	for	the	right	phone.	I
almost	laughed	in	detention	on	Monday	when	Bronwyn	said	nobody
has	 two	 cell	 phones.	 I	 have	 three:	 one	 for	 people	 I	 know,	 one	 for
suppliers,	and	one	for	customers.	Plus	extras	so	I	can	switch	them	out.
But	I	wouldn’t	be	stupid	enough	to	take	any	of	them	into	Avery’s	class.

My	work	phones	are	always	set	to	vibrate,	so	I	know	it’s	a	personal
message.	I	pull	out	my	ancient	iPhone	and	see	a	text	from	Amber,	a	girl
I	met	at	a	party	last	month.	 _U	up?_

I	hesitate.	Amber’s	hot	and	never	tries	to	hang	out	too	long,	but
she	was	just	here	a	few	nights	ago.	Things	get	messy	when	I	let	casual
hookups	happen	more	than	once	a	week.	But	I’m	restless	and	could	use
a	distraction.

_Come	over,_ 	I	write	back.
I’m	 about	 to	 put	 my	 phone	 away	 when	 another	 text	 comes
through.	 It’s	 from	 Chad	 Posner,	 a	 guy	 at	 Bayview	 I	 hang	 out	 with
sometimes.	 _You	see	this?_ 	I	click	on	the	link	in	the	message	and	it	opens
a	Tumblr	page	with	the	headline	“About	This.”

```
I	got	the	idea	for	killing	Simon	while	watching	 Dateline.
I’d	been	thinking	about	it	for	a	while,	obviously.	That’s	not	the	kind	of	thing
you	pluck	out	of	thin	air.	But	the	 how 	of	getting	away	with	it	always	stopped	me.
I	don’t	kid	myself	that	I’m	a	criminal	mastermind.	And	I’m	much	too	good-
looking	for	prison.
On	the	show,	a	guy	killed	his	wife.	Standard	 Dateline 	stuff,	right?	It’s
always	the	husband.	But	turns	out	lots	of	people	were	happy	to	see	her	gone.
She’d	gotten	a	coworker	fired,	screwed	over	people	on	city	council,	and	had	an
affair	with	a	friend’s	husband.	She	was	a	nightmare,	basically.
The	guy	on	 Dateline 	wasn’t	too	bright.	Hired	someone	to	murder	his	wife
and	the	cell	phone	records	were	easy	to	trace.	But	before	those	came	out	he
had	a	decent	smoke	screen	because	of	all	the	other	suspects.	That’s	the	kind
of	person	you	can	get	away	with	killing:	someone	everybody	else	wants	dead.
Let’s	face	it:	everyone	at	Bayview	High	hated	Simon.	I	was	just	the	only
one	with	enough	guts	to	do	something	about	it.
You’re	welcome.
```
The	phone	almost	slips	out	of	my	hand.	Another	text	from	Chad
Posner	came	through	while	I	was	reading.	 _People	r	fucked	up._

I	text	back,	 _Where’d	you	get	this?_
Posner	writes	 _Some	rando	emailed	a	link,_ 	with	the	laughing-so-
hard-I’m-crying	emoji.	He	thinks	it’s	somebody’s	idea	of	a	sick	joke.


Which	is	what	most	people	would	think,	if	they	hadn’t	spent	an	hour
with	a	police	officer	asking	ten	different	ways	how	peanut	oil	got	into
Simon	Kelleher’s	cup.	Along	with	three	other	people	who	looked	guilty
as	hell.

None	of	them	have	as	much	experience	as	I	do	keeping	a	straight
face	when	shit’s	falling	apart	around	them.	At	least,	none	of	them	are
as	good	at	it	as	me.


**Bronwyn**

**Friday,	September	28,	6:45	p.m.**

Friday	evening	is	a	relief.	Maeve	and	I	are	settled	into	her	room	for	a
_Buffy	 the	 Vampire	 Slayer_ marathon	 on	 Netflix.	 It’s	 our	 latest
obsession,	and	I’ve	been	looking	forward	to	it	all	week,	but	tonight	we
only	half	pay	attention.	Maeve’s	curled	up	on	the	window	seat,	tapping
away	on	her	laptop,	and	I’m	sprawled	across	her	bed	with	my	Kindle
open	 to	 _Ulysses_ by	 James	 Joyce.	 It’s	 number	 one	 on	 the	 Modern
Library’s	100	Best	Novels	and	I’m	determined	to	finish	it	before	the
semester’s	over,	but	it’s	pretty	slow	going.	And	I	can’t	concentrate.

All	anybody	could	talk	about	at	school	today	was	that	Tumblr	post.
A	bunch	of	kids	had	the	link	emailed	to	them	last	night	from	some
“About	This”	Gmail	address,	and	by	lunchtime	everyone	had	read	it.
Yumiko	helps	out	in	the	principal’s	office	on	Fridays,	and	she	heard
them	talking	about	trying	to	track	whoever	did	it	by	IP	address.

I	doubt	they’ll	have	any	luck.	Nobody	with	half	a	brain	would	send
something	like	that	from	their	own	technology.

Since	detention	on	Monday	people	have	been	careful	and	overly
nice	to	me,	but	today	was	different.	Conversations	kept	stopping	when
I	approached.	Yumiko	finally	said,	“It’s	not	like	people	think	 _you_ 	sent
it.	They	just	think	it’s	weird,	how	you	guys	got	questioned	by	the	police
yesterday	and	then	this	pops	up.”	Like	that	was	supposed	to	make	me
feel	better.

“Just	imagine.”	Maeve’s	voice	startles	me	back	to	her	bedroom.
She	puts	aside	her	laptop	and	raps	her	fingers	lightly	on	the	window.
“This	time	next	year,	you’ll	be	at	Yale.	What	do	you	think	you’ll	do
there	on	a	Friday	night?	Frat	party?”

I	 roll	 my	 eyes	 at	 her.	 “Right,	 because	 you	 get	 a	 personality
transplant	along	with	your	acceptance	letter.	Anyway,	I	still	have	to	get
in.”


“You	will.	How	could	you	not?”
I	shift	restlessly	on	the	bed.	 _Lots	of	ways._ 	“You	never	know.”
Maeve	keeps	tapping	her	fingers	against	the	glass.	“If	you’re	being
modest	on	my	account,	you	can	give	it	a	rest.	I’m	quite	comfortable	in
my	role	as	the	family	slacker.”

“You’re	not	a	slacker,”	I	protest.	She	just	grins	and	flutters	a	hand.
Maeve’s	one	of	the	smartest	people	I	know,	but	until	her	freshman	year
she	was	too	sick	to	go	to	school	consistently.	She	was	diagnosed	with
leukemia	when	she	was	seven,	and	wasn’t	fully	disease-free	until	two
years	ago,	when	she	was	fourteen.

We	almost	lost	her	a	couple	of	times.	Once	when	I	was	in	fourth
grade,	I	overheard	a	priest	at	the	hospital	asking	my	parents	if	they’d
considered	starting	to	make	“arrangements.”	I	knew	what	he	meant.	I
bowed	my	head	and	prayed:	 _Please	don’t	take	her.	I’ll	do	everything
right	if	you	let	her	stay.	I’ll	be	perfect.	I	promise._

After	so	many	years	in	and	out	of	the	hospital,	Maeve	never	really
learned	how	to	participate	in	life.	I	do	that	for	both	of	us:	join	the
clubs,	win	the	awards,	and	get	the	grades	so	I	can	go	to	Yale	like	our
parents	did.	It	makes	them	happy,	and	keeps	Maeve	from	extending
herself	too	much.

Maeve	goes	back	to	staring	out	the	window	with	her	usual	faraway
expression.	She	looks	like	a	daydream	herself:	pale	and	ethereal,	with
dark-brown	hair	like	mine	but	startling	amber	eyes.	I’m	about	to	ask
what	she’s	thinking	when	she	suddenly	sits	up	straight	and	cups	her
hands	around	her	eyes,	pressing	her	face	against	the	window.	“Is	that
Nate	Macauley?”	I	snort	without	moving,	and	she	says,	“I’m	serious.
Check	it	out.”

I	get	up	and	lean	in	next	to	her.	I	can	just	about	make	out	the	faint
outline	of	a	motorcycle	in	our	driveway.	“What	the	hell?”	Maeve	and	I
exchange	glances,	and	she	shoots	me	a	wicked	grin.	 _“What?”_ 	I	ask.	My
voice	comes	out	more	snappish	than	I	intended.

_“What?”_ 	she	mimics.	“You	think	I	don’t	remember	you	mooning
over	him	in	elementary	school?	I	was	sick,	not	dead.”

“Don’t	joke	about	that.	 _God._ 	And	that	was	light-years	ago.”	Nate’s
motorcycle	is	still	in	our	driveway,	not	moving.	“What	do	you	suppose
he’s	doing	here?”


“Only	one	way	to	find	out.”	Maeve’s	voice	is	annoyingly	singsongy,
and	she	ignores	the	dirty	look	I	give	her	as	I	stand	up.

My	heart	thumps	all	the	way	downstairs.	Nate	and	I	have	talked
more	 at	 school	 this	 week	 than	 we	 have	 since	 fifth	 grade,	 which
admittedly	still	isn’t	much.	Every	time	I	see	him	I	get	the	impression
he	can’t	wait	to	be	someplace	else.	But	I	keep	running	into	him.

Opening	the	front	door	triggers	a	floodlight	in	front	of	our	garage
that	makes	Nate	look	as	though	he’s	on	center	stage.	As	I	walk	toward
him	my	nerves	are	jangling,	and	I’m	acutely	conscious	of	the	fact	that
I’m	 in	 my	 usual	 hanging-out-with-Maeve	 ensemble:	 flip-flops,	 a
hoodie,	and	athletic	shorts.	Not	that	 _he’s_ 	making	an	effort.	I’ve	seen
that	Guinness	T-shirt	at	least	twice	this	week.

“Hi,	Nate,”	I	say.	“What’s	up?”
Nate	takes	his	helmet	off,	and	his	dark-blue	eyes	flick	past	me	to
our	 front	 door.	 “Hey.”	 He	 doesn’t	 say	 anything	 else	 for	 an
uncomfortably	long	time.	I	cross	my	arms	and	wait	him	out.	Finally	he
meets	my	gaze	with	a	wry	smile	that	makes	my	stomach	do	a	slow
somersault.	“I	don’t	have	a	good	reason	for	being	here.”

“Do	you	want	to	come	in?”	I	blurt	out.
He	hesitates.	“I	bet	your	parents	would	love	that.”
He	doesn’t	know	the	half	of	it.	Dad’s	least	favorite	stereotype	is
that	of	the	Colombian	drug	dealer,	and	he	wouldn’t	appreciate	even	a
hint	of	association	from	me.	But	I	find	myself	saying,	“They’re	not
home.”	Then	I	hastily	add,	“I’m	hanging	out	with	my	sister,”	before	he
thinks	that	was	some	sort	of	come-on.

“Yeah,	okay.”	Nate	gets	off	his	bike	and	follows	me	like	it’s	no	big
deal,	so	I	try	to	act	equally	nonchalant.	Maeve’s	leaning	against	the
kitchen	counter	when	we	get	inside,	even	though	I’m	sure	she	was
staring	out	her	bedroom	window	ten	seconds	ago.	“Have	you	met	my
sister,	Maeve?”

Nate	shakes	his	head.	“No.	How’s	it	going?”
“All	right,”	Maeve	answers,	eyeing	him	with	frank	interest.
I	have	no	idea	what	to	do	next	as	he	shrugs	off	his	jacket	and
tosses	it	over	a	kitchen	chair.	How	am	I	supposed	to... _entertain_ 	Nate
Macauley?	It’s	not	even	my	responsibility,	right?	He’s	the	one	who


showed	up	out	of	the	blue.	I	should	do	what	I	normally	do.	Except
that’s	sit	in	my	sister’s	room	and	watch	retro	vampire	shows	while	half
reading	 _Ulysses._

I’m	completely	out	of	my	depth	here.
Nate	 doesn’t	 notice	 my	 discomfort,	 wandering	 past	 the	 french
doors	that	open	into	our	living	room.	Maeve	elbows	me	as	we	follow
him	and	murmurs,	 _“Que	boca	tan	hermosa.”_

“Shut	up,”	I	hiss.	Dad	encourages	us	to	speak	Spanish	around	the
house,	but	I	doubt	this	is	what	he	had	in	mind.	Besides,	for	all	we
know,	Nate’s	fluent.

He	stops	at	the	grand	piano	and	looks	back	at	us.	“Who	plays?”
“Bronwyn,”	Maeve	says	before	I	can	even	open	my	mouth.	I	stay
near	 the	 doorway,	 arms	 folded,	 as	 she	 settles	 into	 Dad’s	 favorite
leather	armchair	in	front	of	the	sliding	door	leading	to	our	deck.	“She’s
really	good.”

“Oh	yeah?”	Nate	asks	at	the	same	time	I	say,	“No,	I’m	not.”
“You	are,”	Maeve	insists.	I	narrow	my	eyes	and	she	widens	hers	in
fake	innocence.

Nate	 crosses	 to	 the	 large	 walnut	 bookcase	 covering	 one	 wall,
picking	 up	 a	 picture	 of	 Maeve	 and	 me	 with	 identical	 gap-toothed
smiles	in	front	of	Cinderella’s	castle	at	Disneyland.	It	was	taken	six
months	before	Maeve	was	diagnosed,	and	for	a	long	time	it	was	the
only	vacation	picture	we	had.	He	studies	it,	then	glances	my	way	with	a
small	smile.	Maeve	was	right	about	his	mouth—it	is	sexy.	“You	should
play	something.”

Well,	it’s	easier	than	talking	to	him.
I	shuffle	to	the	bench	and	sit,	adjusting	the	sheet	music	in	front	of
me.	 It’s	 “Variations	 on	 the	 Canon,”	 which	 I’ve	 been	 practicing	 for
months	 now.	 I’ve	 taken	 lessons	 since	 I	 was	 eight	 and	 I’m	 pretty
competent,	 technically.	 But	 I’ve	 never	 made	 people	 _feel_ anything.
“Variations	on	the	Canon”	is	the	first	piece	that	made	me	want	to	try.
There’s	something	about	the	way	it	builds,	starting	soft	and	sweet	but
gaining	in	volume	and	intensity	until	it’s	almost	angry.	That’s	the	hard
part,	 because	 at	 a	 certain	 point	 the	 notes	 grow	 harsh,	 verging	 on
discordant,	and	I	can’t	muster	the	force	to	pull	it	off.


I	haven’t	played	it	in	over	a	week.	The	last	time	I	tried	I	hit	so
many	 wrong	 notes,	 even	 Maeve	 winced.	 She	 seems	 to	 remember,
glancing	toward	Nate	and	saying,	“This	is	a	really	hard	song.”	As	if	she
suddenly	regrets	setting	me	up	for	embarrassment.	But	what	the	hell.
This	 whole	 situation	 is	 too	 surreal	 to	 take	 seriously.	 If	 I	 woke	 up
tomorrow	and	Maeve	told	me	I’d	dreamed	it	all,	I’d	fully	accept	that.

So	I	start,	and	right	away	it	feels	different.	Looser	and	less	of	a
reach	for	the	harder	parts.	For	a	few	minutes	I	forget	anyone’s	in	the
room,	and	enjoy	how	notes	that	usually	trip	me	up	flow	easily.	Even
the	crescendo—I	don’t	attack	it	as	hard	as	I	need	to,	but	I’m	faster	and
surer	than	I	normally	am,	and	don’t	hit	a	single	wrong	note.	When	I
finish	I	smile	triumphantly	at	Maeve,	and	it’s	only	when	her	eyes	drift
toward	Nate	that	I	remember	I	have	an	audience	of	two.

He’s	leaning	against	our	bookcase,	arms	crossed,	and	for	once	he
doesn’t	look	bored	or	about	to	make	fun	of	me.	“That’s	the	best	thing
I’ve	ever	heard,”	he	says.

**Addy**

**Friday,	September	28,	7:00	p.m.**

God,	my	mother.	She’s	actually	 _flirting_ 	with	Officer	Budapest,	of	the
pink	freckled	face	and	receding	hairline.	“Of	course	Adelaide	will	do
anything	to	help,”	she	says	in	a	husky	voice,	trailing	one	finger	around
the	rim	of	her	wineglass.	Justin’s	having	dinner	with	his	parents,	who
hate	Mom	and	never	invite	her.	This	is	his	punishment	whether	he
knows	it	or	not.

Officer	Budapest	stopped	by	just	as	we	finished	the	vegetable	pad
Thai	Mom	always	orders	when	my	sister,	Ashton,	comes	to	visit.	Now
he	doesn’t	know	where	to	look,	so	he’s	got	his	eyes	fixed	on	a	dried
flower	arrangement	on	the	living	room	wall.	My	mother	redecorates
every	six	months,	and	her	latest	theme	is	shabby	chic	with	a	weird
beachy	edge.	Cabbage	roses	and	seashells	as	far	as	the	eye	can	see.

“Just	a	few	follow-up	points,	if	you	don’t	mind,	Addy,”	he	says.
“Okay,”	I	say.	I’m	surprised	he’s	here,	since	I	thought	we’d	already
answered	all	his	questions.	But	I	guess	the	investigation’s	still	going
strong.	Today	Mr.	Avery’s	lab	was	blocked	off	with	yellow	tape,	and
police	officers	were	in	and	out	of	school	all	day.	Cooper	said	Bayview
High’s	probably	going	to	get	into	trouble	for	having	peanut	oil	in	the
water	or	something.


I	glance	at	my	mother.	Her	eyes	are	fixed	on	Officer	Budapest,	but
with	 that	 distant	 expression	 I	 know	 well.	 She’s	 already	 mentally
checked	out,	probably	planning	her	wardrobe	for	the	weekend.	Ashton
comes	into	the	living	room	and	settles	herself	in	an	armchair	across
from	me.	“Are	you	talking	to	all	the	kids	who	were	in	detention	that
day?”	she	asks.

Officer	Budapest	clears	his	throat.	“The	investigation	is	ongoing,
but	I’m	here	because	I	had	a	particular	question	for	Addy.	You	were	in
the	nurse’s	office	the	day	Simon	died,	is	that	right?”

I	 hesitate	 and	 dart	 a	 glance	 toward	 Ashton,	 then	 look	 back	 at
Officer	Budapest.	“No.”

“You	were,”	Officer	Budapest	says.	“It’s	in	the	nurse’s	log.”
I’m	looking	at	the	fireplace,	but	I	can	feel	Ashton’s	eyes	boring
into	me.	I	wind	a	strand	of	hair	around	my	finger	and	tug	nervously.	“I
don’t	remember	that.”

“You	don’t	remember	going	to	the	nurse’s	office	on	Monday?”
“Well,	I	go	a	lot,”	I	say	quickly.	“For	headaches	and	stuff.	It	was
probably	for	that.”	I	scrunch	my	forehead	like	I’m	thinking	hard,	and
finally	meet	Officer	Budapest’s	eyes.	“Oh,	right.	I	had	my	period	and	I
was	cramping	really	bad,	so	yeah.	I	needed	Tylenol.”

Officer	Budapest	is	a	blusher.	He	turns	red	as	I	smile	politely	and
release	 my	 hair.	 “And	 you	 got	 what	 you	 needed	 there?	 Just	 the
Tylenol?”

“Why	do	you	want	to	know?”	Ashton	asks.	She	rearranges	a	throw
pillow	behind	her	so	the	starfish	pattern,	made	out	of	actual	seashells,
isn’t	digging	into	her	back.

“Well,	one	of	the	things	we’re	looking	into	is	why	there	appeared
to	be	no	EpiPens	in	the	nurse’s	office	during	Simon’s	allergy	attack.
The	nurse	swears	she	had	several	pens	that	morning.	But	they	were
gone	that	afternoon.”

Ashton	 stiffens	 and	 says,	 “You	 can’t	 possibly	 think	 Addy	 took
them!”	Mom	turns	to	me	with	a	faintly	surprised	air,	but	doesn’t	speak.

If	Officer	Budapest	notices	that	my	sister	has	stepped	into	the
parenting	role	here,	he	doesn’t	mention	it.	“Nobody’s	saying	that.	But
did	you	happen	to	see	whether	the	pens	were	in	the	office	then,	Addy?


According	to	the	nurse’s	log,	you	were	there	at	one	o’clock.”

My	heart’s	beating	uncomfortably	fast,	but	I	keep	my	tone	even.	“I
don’t	even	know	what	an	EpiPen	looks	like.”

He	makes	me	tell	him	everything	I	remember	about	detention,
_again,_ 	then	asks	a	bunch	of	questions	about	the	Tumblr	post.	Ashton’s
all	alert	and	interested,	leaning	forward	and	interrupting	the	whole
time,	while	Mom	goes	into	the	kitchen	twice	to	refill	her	wineglass.	I
keep	looking	at	the	clock,	because	Jake	and	I	are	supposed	to	be	going
to	the	beach	soon	and	I	haven’t	even	started	touching	up	my	makeup.
My	pimple’s	not	going	to	cover	itself.

When	Officer	Budapest	finally	gets	ready	to	leave,	he	hands	me	a
card.	“Call	if	you	remember	anything	else,	Addy,”	he	says.	“You	never
know	what	might	be	important.”

“Okay,”	I	say,	sliding	the	card	into	the	back	pocket	of	my	jeans.
Officer	Budapest	says	good-bye	to	Mom	and	Ashton	as	I	open	the	door
for	him.	Ashton	leans	against	the	doorframe	next	to	me	and	we	watch
Officer	Budapest	get	into	his	squad	wagon	and	start	slowly	backing	out
of	our	driveway.

I	spy	Justin’s	car	waiting	to	pull	in	behind	Officer	Budapest,	and
that	gets	me	moving	again.	I	don’t	want	to	have	to	talk	to	him	and	I
_still_ haven’t	 fixed	 my	 makeup,	 so	 I	 escape	 upstairs	 with	 Ashton
following	 behind	 me.	 My	 bedroom	 is	 the	 biggest	 one	 in	 our	 house
except	the	master,	and	used	to	be	Ashton’s	until	I	took	it	over	when	she
got	married.	She	still	makes	herself	at	home	there	as	if	she’d	never	left.

“You	didn’t	tell	me	about	that	Tumblr	thing,”	she	says,	sprawling
across	my	white	eyelet	bedspread	and	opening	the	latest	issue	of	 _Us
Weekly._ 	Ashton	is	even	blonder	than	me,	but	her	hair	is	cut	in	chin-
length	layers	that	our	mother	hates.	I	think	it’s	cute,	though.	If	Jake
didn’t	love	my	hair	so	much,	I’d	consider	a	cut	like	that.

I	 sit	 at	 my	 vanity	 and	 dab	 concealer	 on	 my	 hairline	 pimple.
“Somebody’s	being	a	creep,	that’s	all.”

“Did	you	really	not	remember	being	in	the	nurse’s	office?	Or	did
you	just	not	want	to	answer?”	Ashton	asks.	I	fumble	with	the	concealer
cap,	but	I’m	saved	from	answering	when	my	phone	blares	its	Rihanna
“Only	Girl”	text	tone	from	the	bedside	table.	Ashton	picks	it	up	and
reports,	“Jake’s	almost	here.”


“God,	Ash.”	I	glare	at	her	in	the	mirror.	“You	shouldn’t	look	at	my
phone	like	that.	What	if	it	was	private?”

“Sorry,”	she	says	in	a	completely	not-sorry	tone.	“Everything	okay
with	Jake?”

I	twist	in	my	chair	to	face	her,	frowning.	“Why	wouldn’t	it	be?”
Ashton	holds	a	palm	up	at	me.	“Just	a	question,	Addy.	I’m	not
implying	anything.”	Her	tone	darkens.	“No	reason	to	think	you’ll	turn
out	 like	 me.	 It’s	 not	 as	 though	 Charlie	 and	 I	 were	 high	 school
sweethearts.”

I	blink	at	her	in	surprise.	I	mean,	I’ve	thought	for	a	while	that
things	weren’t	going	well	between	Ashton	and	Charlie—for	one	thing,
she’s	suddenly	here	a	lot,	and	for	another,	he	was	hard-core	flirting
with	 a	 slutty	 bridesmaid	 at	 our	 cousin’s	 wedding	 last	 month—but
Ashton’s	never	come	out	and	admitted	a	problem	before.	“Are	things...
uh,	really	bad?”

She	shrugs,	dropping	the	magazine	and	picking	at	her	nails.	“It’s
complicated.	Marriage	is	way	harder	than	anyone	tells	you.	Be	thankful
you	don’t	have	to	make	life	decisions	yet.”	Her	mouth	tightens.	“Don’t
let	 Mom	 get	 in	 your	 ear	 and	 twist	 everything.	 Just	 enjoy	 being
seventeen.”

_I	can’t.	I’m	too	afraid	it’s	all	going	to	be	ruined.	That	it’s	already
ruined._

I	wish	I	could	tell	Ashton	that.	It	would	be	such	a	relief	to	get	it
out.	I	usually	tell	Jake	everything,	but	I	can’t	tell	him	 _this._ 	And	after
him,	there’s	literally	not	one	other	person	in	the	world	I	trust.	Not	any
of	my	friends,	certainly	not	my	mother,	and	not	my	sister.	Because
even	 though	 she	 probably	 means	 well,	 she	 can	 be	 awfully	 passive-
aggressive	about	Jake.

The	doorbell	rings,	and	Ashton’s	mouth	twists	into	a	half	smile.
“Must	be	Mr.	Perfect,”	she	says.	Sarcastic,	right	on	schedule.

I	ignore	her	and	bound	down	the	stairs,	opening	the	door	with	the
big	smile	I	can’t	help	when	I’m	about	to	see	Jake.	And	there	he	is,	in
his	football	jacket	with	his	chestnut	hair	tousled	by	the	wind,	giving	me
the	exact	same	smile	back.	“Hey,	baby.”	I’m	about	to	kiss	him	when	I
catch	sight	of	another	figure	behind	him	and	freeze.	“You	don’t	mind	if
we	give	TJ	a	ride,	do	you?”


A	nervous	laugh	bubbles	up	in	my	throat	and	I	push	it	down.	“Of
course	not.”	I	go	in	for	my	kiss,	but	the	moment’s	ruined.

TJ	flicks	his	eyes	toward	me,	then	at	the	ground.	“Sorry	about	this.
My	car	broke	down	and	I	was	gonna	stay	home,	but	Jake	insisted....”

Jake	shrugs.	“You	were	on	the	way.	No	reason	to	miss	a	night	out
because	of	car	trouble.”	His	eyes	travel	from	my	face	to	my	canvas
sneakers	as	he	asks,	“You	wearing	that,	Ads?”

It’s	not	a	criticism,	exactly,	but	I’m	in	Ashton’s	college	sweatshirt
and	Jake’s	never	liked	me	in	shapeless	clothes.	“It’ll	be	cold	at	the
beach,”	I	say	tentatively,	and	he	grins.

“I’ll	keep	you	warm.	Put	on	something	a	little	cuter,	huh?”
I	give	him	a	strained	smile	and	go	back	inside,	mounting	the	stairs
with	dragging	steps	because	I	know	I	haven’t	been	gone	long	enough
for	 Ashton	 to	 have	 left	 my	 room.	 Sure	 enough	 she’s	 still	 flipping
through	 _Us	Weekly_ 	on	my	bed,	and	she	knits	her	brows	together	as	I
head	for	my	closet.	“Back	so	soon?”

I	 pull	 out	 a	 pair	 of	 leggings	 and	 unbutton	 my	 jeans.	 “I’m
changing.”

Ashton	 closes	 the	 magazine	 and	 watches	 me	 in	 silence	 until	 I
exchange	her	sweatshirt	for	a	formfitting	sweater.	“You	won’t	be	warm
enough	in	that.	It’s	chilly	tonight.”	She	snorts	out	a	disbelieving	laugh
when	I	slip	off	my	sneakers	and	step	into	a	pair	of	strappy	sandals	with
kitten	 heels.	 “You’re	 wearing	 those	 to	 the	 _beach_ ?	 Is	 this	 wardrobe
change	Jake’s	idea?”

I	toss	my	discarded	clothes	into	the	hamper,	ignoring	her.	“Bye,
Ash.”

“Addy,	wait.”	The	snarky	tone’s	gone	from	Ashton’s	voice,	but	I
don’t	care.	I’m	down	the	stairs	and	out	the	door	before	she	can	stop
me,	stepping	into	a	breeze	that	chills	me	instantly.	But	Jake	gives	me
an	approving	smile	and	wraps	an	arm	around	my	shoulders	for	the
short	walk	to	the	car.

I	hate	the	entire	ride.	Hate	sitting	there	acting	normal	when	I	want
to	 throw	 up.	 Hate	 listening	 to	 Jake	 and	 TJ	 talk	 about	 tomorrow’s
game.	Hate	when	the	latest	Fall	Out	Boy	song	comes	on	and	TJ	says,	“I
love	this	song,”	because	now	I	can’t	like	it	anymore.	But	mostly,	I	hate
the	fact	that	barely	a	month	after	my	and	Jake’s	momentous	first	time,


I	got	blind	drunk	and	slept	with	TJ	Forrester.

When	we	get	to	the	beach	Cooper	and	Luis	are	already	building	a
bonfire,	 and	 Jake	 heaves	 a	 frustrated	 grunt	 as	 he	 shifts	 into	 park.
“They	do	it	wrong	every	time,”	he	complains,	launching	himself	out	of
the	car	toward	them.	“You	guys.	You’re	too	close	to	the	water!”

TJ	and	I	get	out	of	the	car	more	slowly,	not	looking	at	each	other.
I’m	already	freezing,	and	wrap	my	arms	around	my	body	for	warmth.
“Do	you	want	my	jack—”	TJ	starts,	but	I	don’t	let	him	finish.

_“No.”_ 	I	cut	him	off	and	stalk	toward	the	beach,	almost	tripping	in
my	stupid	shoes	when	I	reach	the	sand.

TJ’s	at	my	side,	arm	out	to	steady	me.	“Addy,	hey.”	His	voice	is
low,	his	minty	breath	briefly	on	my	cheek.	“It	doesn’t	have	to	be	this
awkward,	you	know?	I’m	not	going	to	say	anything.”

I	shouldn’t	be	mad	at	him.	It’s	not	his	fault.	I’m	the	one	who	got
insecure	after	Jake	and	I	slept	together,	and	started	thinking	he	was
losing	interest	every	time	he	took	too	long	to	answer	a	text.	I’m	the	one
who	flirted	with	TJ	when	we	ran	into	each	other	on	this	exact	same
beach	over	the	summer	while	Jake	was	on	vacation.	I’m	the	one	who
dared	TJ	to	get	a	bottle	of	rum,	and	drank	almost	half	of	it	with	a	Diet
Coke	chaser.

At	one	point	that	day	I	laughed	so	hard	I	snorted	soda	out	of	my
nose,	which	would	have	disgusted	Jake.	TJ	just	said	in	this	dry	way,
“Wow,	Addy,	that	was	attractive.	I’m	very	turned	on	by	you	right	now.”

That	was	when	I	kissed	him.	And	suggested	we	go	back	to	his
place.

So	really,	none	of	this	is	his	fault.
We	reach	the	edge	of	the	beach	and	watch	Jake	douse	the	fire	so
he	 can	 rebuild	 it	 where	 he	 wants.	 I	 sneak	 a	 glance	 at	 TJ	 and	 see
dimples	flash	as	he	waves	to	the	guys.	“Just	forget	it	ever	happened,”
he	says	under	his	breath.

He	sounds	sincere,	and	hope	sparks	in	my	chest.	Maybe	we	really
can	 keep	 this	 to	 ourselves.	 Bayview’s	 a	 gossipy	 school,	 but	 at	 least
About	That	isn’t	hanging	over	everybody’s	heads	anymore.

And	if	I’m	being	one	hundred	percent	honest,	I	have	to	admit—
that’s	a	relief.


**Cooper**

**Saturday,	September	29,	4:15	p.m.**

I	squint	at	the	batter.	We’re	at	full	count	and	he’s	fouled	off	the	last	two
pitches.	He’s	making	me	work,	which	isn’t	good.	In	a	showcase	game
like	 this,	 facing	 a	 right-handed	 second	 baseman	 with	 so-so	 stats,	 I
should’ve	mowed	him	down	already.

Problem	is,	I’m	distracted.	It’s	been	a	hell	of	a	week.
Pop’s	in	the	stands,	and	I	can	picture	exactly	what	he’s	doing.	He’ll
have	taken	his	cap	off,	knotting	it	between	his	hands	as	he	stares	at	the
mound.	Like	burning	a	hole	into	me	with	his	eyes	is	going	to	help.

I	bring	the	ball	into	my	glove	and	glance	at	Luis,	who	catches	for
me	during	regular	season.	He’s	on	the	Bayview	High	football	team	too
but	 got	 permission	 to	 miss	 today’s	 game	 so	 he	 could	 be	 here.	 He
signals	a	fastball,	but	I	shake	my	head.	I’ve	thrown	five	already	and	this
guy’s	figured	every	one	out.	I	keep	shaking	Luis	off	until	he	gives	me
the	signal	I	want.	Luis	adjusts	his	crouch	slightly,	and	we’ve	played
together	long	enough	that	I	can	read	his	thoughts	in	the	movement.
_Your	funeral,	man._

I	position	my	fingers	on	the	ball,	tensing	myself	in	preparation	to
throw.	It’s	not	my	most	consistent	pitch.	If	I	miss,	it’ll	be	a	big	fat
softball	and	this	guy’ll	crush	it.

I	draw	back	and	hurl	as	hard	as	I	can.	My	pitch	heads	straight	for
the	 middle	 of	 the	 plate,	 and	 the	 batter	 takes	 an	 eager,	 triumphant
swing.	Then	the	ball	breaks,	dropping	out	of	the	strike	zone	and	into
Luis’s	glove.	The	stadium	explodes	in	cheers,	and	the	batter	shakes	his
head	like	he	has	no	idea	what	happened.

I	adjust	my	cap	and	try	not	to	look	pleased.	I’ve	been	working	on
that	slider	all	year.

```
I	strike	the	next	hitter	out	on	three	straight	fastballs.	The	last	one
```

hits	ninety-three,	the	fastest	I’ve	ever	pitched.	Lights-out	for	a	lefty.	My
stats	through	two	innings	are	three	strikeouts,	two	groundouts,	and	a
long	fly	that	would’ve	been	a	double	if	the	right	fielder	hadn’t	made	a
diving	catch.	I	wish	I	could	have	that	pitch	back—my	curveball	didn’t
curve—but	other	than	that	I	feel	pretty	good	about	the	game.

I’m	 at	 Petco—the	 Padres’	 stadium—for	 an	 invitation-only
showcase	event,	which	my	father	insisted	I	go	to	even	though	Simon’s
memorial	service	is	in	an	hour.	The	organizers	agreed	to	let	me	pitch
first	 and	 leave	 early,	 so	 I	 skip	 my	 usual	 postgame	 routine,	 take	 a
shower,	and	head	out	of	the	locker	room	with	Luis	to	find	Pop.

I	spot	him	as	someone	calls	my	name.	“Cooper	Clay?”	The	man
approaching	me	looks	successful.	That’s	the	only	way	I	can	think	to
describe	him.	Sharp	clothes,	sharp	haircut,	just	the	right	amount	of	a
tan,	 and	 a	 confident	 smile	 as	 he	 holds	 his	 hand	 out	 to	 me.	 “Josh
Langley	with	the	Padres.	I’ve	spoken	to	your	coach	a	few	times.”

“Yes,	 sir.	 Pleased	 to	 meet	 you,”	 I	 say.	 My	 father	 grins	 like
somebody	just	handed	him	the	keys	to	a	Lamborghini.	He	manages	to
introduce	himself	to	Josh	without	drooling,	but	barely.

“Hell	of	a	slider	you	threw	there,”	Josh	says	to	me.	“Fell	right	off
the	plate.”

“Thank	you,	sir.”
“Good	velocity	on	your	fastball	too.	You’ve	really	brought	that	up
since	the	spring,	haven’t	you?”

“I’ve	been	working	out	a	lot,”	I	say.	“Building	up	arm	strength.”
“Big	jump	in	a	short	time,”	Josh	observes,	and	for	a	second	the
statement	hangs	in	the	air	between	us	like	a	question.	Then	he	claps	a
hand	on	my	shoulder.	“Well,	keep	it	up,	son.	Nice	to	have	a	local	boy
on	our	radar.	Makes	my	job	easy.	Less	travel.”	He	flashes	a	smile,	nods
good-bye	to	my	dad	and	Luis,	and	takes	off.

_Big	jump	in	a	short	time._ 	It’s	true.	Eighty-eight	miles	per	hour	to
ninety-three	in	a	few	months	is	unusual.

Pop	 won’t	 shut	 up	 on	 the	 way	 home,	 alternating	 between
complaining	about	what	I	did	wrong	and	crowing	about	Josh	Langley.
He	winds	up	in	a	good	mood,	though,	more	happy	about	the	Padres
scout	than	upset	about	someone	almost	getting	a	hit	off	me.	“Simon’s
family	gonna	be	there?”	he	asks	as	he	pulls	up	to	Bayview	High.	“Pay


our	respects	if	they	are.”

“I	dunno,”	I	answer	him.	“It	might	just	be	a	school	thing.”
“Hat	off,	boys,”	Pop	says.	Luis	crams	his	into	the	pocket	of	his
football	jacket,	and	Pop	raps	the	steering	wheel	impatiently	when	I
hesitate.	 “Come	 on,	 Cooper,	 it	 might	 be	 outside	 but	 this	 is	 still	 a
service.	Leave	it	in	the	car.”

I	do	as	I’m	told	and	get	out,	but	as	I	run	a	hand	through	my	hat-
hair	and	close	the	passenger	door,	I	wish	I	had	it	back.	I	feel	exposed,
and	people	have	already	been	staring	at	me	enough	this	week.	If	it
were	 up	 to	 me	 I’d	 go	 home	 and	 spend	 a	 quiet	 evening	 watching
baseball	with	my	brother	and	Nonny,	but	there’s	no	way	I	can	miss
Simon’s	memorial	service	when	I	was	one	of	the	last	people	to	see	him
alive.

We	start	toward	the	crowd	on	the	football	field,	and	I	text	Keely	to
find	out	where	our	friends	are.	She	tells	me	they’re	near	the	front,	so
we	duck	under	the	bleachers	and	try	to	spot	them	from	the	sidelines.	I
have	my	eyes	on	the	crowd,	and	don’t	see	the	girl	in	front	of	me	until	I
almost	 bump	 into	 her.	 She’s	 leaning	 against	 a	 post,	 watching	 the
football	field	with	her	hands	stuffed	into	the	pockets	of	her	oversized
jacket.

“Sorry,”	I	say,	and	realize	who	it	is.	“Oh,	hey,	Leah.	You	heading
out	 to	 the	 field?”	 Then	 I	 wish	 I	 could	 swallow	 my	 words,	 because
there’s	 no	 way	 in	 hell	 Leah	 Jackson’s	 here	 to	 mourn	 Simon.	 She
actually	tried	to	kill	herself	last	year	because	of	him.	After	he	wrote
about	her	sleeping	with	a	bunch	of	freshmen,	she	was	harassed	on
social	media	for	months.	She	slit	her	wrists	in	her	bathroom	and	was
out	of	school	for	the	rest	of	the	year.

Leah	snorts.	“Yeah,	right.	Good	riddance.”	She	stares	at	the	scene
in	front	of	us,	kicking	the	toe	of	her	boot	into	the	dirt.	“Nobody	could
stand	him,	but	they’re	all	holding	candles	like	he’s	some	kind	of	martyr
instead	of	a	gossipy	douchebag.”

She’s	not	wrong,	but	now	doesn’t	seem	like	the	time	to	be	that
honest.	Still,	I’m	not	going	to	try	defending	Simon	to	Leah.	“I	guess
people	want	to	pay	their	respects,”	I	hedge.

“Hypocrites,”	she	mutters,	cramming	her	hands	deeper	into	her
pockets.	Her	expression	shifts,	and	she	pulls	out	her	phone	with	a	sly
look.	“You	guys	see	the	latest?”


“Latest	what?”	I	ask	with	a	sinking	feeling.	Sometimes	the	best
thing	about	baseball	is	the	fact	that	you	can’t	check	your	phone	while
you’re	playing.

“There’s	another	email	with	a	Tumblr	update.”	Leah	swipes	a	few
times	at	her	phone	and	hands	it	to	me.	I	take	it	reluctantly	and	look	at
the	screen	as	Luis	reads	over	my	shoulder.

```
Time	to	clarify	a	few	things.
Simon	had	a	severe	peanut	allergy—so	why	not	stick	a	Planters	into	his
sandwich	and	be	done	with	it?
I’d	been	watching	Simon	Kelleher	for	months.	Everything	he	ate	was
wrapped	in	an	inch	of	cellophane.	He	carried	that	goddamn	water	bottle
everywhere	and	it	was	all	he	drank.
But	he	couldn’t	go	ten	minutes	without	swigging	from	that	bottle.	I	figured	if
it	wasn’t	there,	he’d	default	to	plain	old	tap	water.	So	yeah,	I	took	it.
I	spent	a	long	time	figuring	out	where	I	could	slip	peanut	oil	into	one	of
Simon’s	drinks.	Someplace	contained,	without	a	water	fountain.	Mr.	Avery’s
detention	seemed	like	the	ideal	spot.
I	did	feel	bad	watching	Simon	die.	I’m	not	a	sociopath.	In	that	moment,	as
he	turned	that	horrible	color	and	fought	for	air—if	I	could	have	stopped	it,
I	would	have.
I	couldn’t,	though.	Because,	you	see,	I’d	taken	his	EpiPen.	And	every	last
one	in	the	nurse’s	office.
```
My	heart	starts	hammering	and	my	stomach	clenches.	The	first
post	was	bad	enough,	but	this	one—this	one’s	written	like	the	person
was	actually	in	the	room	when	Simon	had	his	attack.	Like	it	was	one	of
us.

Luis	snorts.	“That’s	fucked	up.”
Leah’s	 watching	 me	 closely,	 and	 I	 grimace	 as	 I	 hand	 back
the	phone.	“Hope	they	figure	out	who’s	writing	this	stuff.	It’s	pretty
sick.”

She	lifts	one	shoulder	in	a	shrug.	“I	guess.”	She	starts	to	back
away.	“Have	a	blast	 _mourning,_ 	guys.	I’m	outta	here.”

“Bye,	 Leah.”	 I	 squelch	 the	 urge	 to	 follow	 her,	 and	 we	 trudge
forward	until	we	hit	the	ten-yard	line.	I	start	shouldering	through	the
crowd	and	finally	find	Keely	and	the	rest	of	our	friends.	When	I	reach
her,	she	hands	me	a	candle	she	lights	with	her	own,	and	loops	her	arm
through	mine.

```
Principal	Gupta	steps	up	to	the	microphone	and	taps	against	it.
```

“What	a	terrible	week	for	our	school,”	she	says.	“But	how	inspiring	to
see	all	of	you	gathered	here	tonight.”

I	should	be	thinking	about	Simon,	but	my	head’s	too	full	of	other
stuff.	Keely,	who’s	gripping	my	arm	a	little	too	tight.	Leah,	saying	the
kind	of	things	most	people	only	think.	The	new	Tumblr—posted	right
before	Simon’s	memorial	service.	And	Josh	Langley	with	his	flashy
smile:	 _Big	jump	in	a	short	time._

That’s	the	thing	about	competitive	edges.	Sometimes	they’re	too
good	to	be	true.

**Nate**

**Sunday,	September	30,	12:30	p.m.**

My	probation	officer	isn’t	the	worst.	She’s	in	her	thirties,	not	bad-
looking,	and	has	a	sense	of	humor.	But	she’s	a	pain	in	my	ass	about
school.

“How	did	your	history	exam	go?”	We’re	sitting	in	the	kitchen	for
our	usual	Sunday	meeting.	Stan’s	hanging	out	on	the	table,	which	she’s
fine	with	since	she	likes	him.	My	dad	is	upstairs,	something	I	always
arrange	before	Officer	Lopez	comes	over.	Part	of	her	job	is	to	make
sure	I’m	being	adequately	supervised.	She	knew	his	deal	the	first	time
she	saw	him,	but	she	also	knows	I’ve	got	nowhere	else	to	go	and	state
care	can	be	way	worse	than	alcoholic	neglect.	It’s	easier	to	pretend	he’s
a	fit	guardian	when	he’s	not	passed	out	in	the	living	room.

“It	went,”	I	say.
She	waits	patiently	for	more.	When	it	doesn’t	come,	she	asks,	“Did
you	study?”

“I’ve	been	kind	of	distracted,”	I	remind	her.	She’d	heard	the	Simon
story	from	her	cop	pals,	and	we	spent	the	first	half	hour	after	she	got
here	talking	about	what	happened.

“I	understand.	But	keeping	up	with	school	is	important,	Nate.	It’s
part	of	the	deal.”

She	brings	up	The	Deal	every	week.	San	Diego	County	is	getting
tougher	on	juvenile	drug	offenses,	and	she	thinks	I	was	lucky	to	get
probation.	 A	 bad	 report	 from	 her	 could	 put	 me	 back	 in	 front	 of	 a
pissed-off	judge.	Another	drug	bust	could	land	me	in	juvie.	So	every
Sunday	morning	before	she	shows	up,	I	gather	up	all	my	unsold	drugs
and	burner	phones	and	stick	them	in	our	senile	neighbor’s	shed.	Just


in	case.

Officer	 Lopez	 holds	 out	 her	 palm	 to	 Stan,	 who	 crawls	 halfway
toward	it	before	he	loses	interest.	She	picks	him	up	and	lays	him	across
her	 arm.	 “How	 has	 your	 week	 been	 otherwise?	 Tell	 me	 something
positive	that	happened.”	She	always	says	that,	as	if	life	is	full	of	great
shit	I	can	store	up	and	report	every	Sunday.

“I	got	to	three	thousand	in	 _Grand	Theft	Auto._ ”
She	rolls	her	eyes.	She	does	that	a	lot	at	my	house.	“Something
else.	What	progress	have	you	made	toward	your	goals?”

Jesus.	 My	 _goals._ She	 made	 me	 write	 a	 list	 at	 our	 first
appointment.	There’s	not	anything	I	actually	care	about	on	there,	just
stuff	I	know	she	wants	to	hear	about	school	and	jobs.	And	friends,
which	she’s	figured	by	now	I	don’t	have.	I	have	people	I	go	to	parties
with,	sell	to,	and	screw,	but	I	wouldn’t	call	any	of	them	friends.

“It’s	been	a	slow	week,	goal-wise.”
“Did	you	look	at	that	Alateen	literature	I	left	you?”
Nope.	I	didn’t.	I	don’t	need	a	brochure	to	tell	me	how	bad	it	sucks
when	your	only	parent’s	a	drunk,	and	I	definitely	don’t	need	to	talk
about	it	with	a	bunch	of	whiners	in	a	church	basement	somewhere.
“Yeah,”	I	lie.	“I’m	thinking	about	it.”

I’m	sure	she	sees	right	through	me,	since	she’s	not	stupid.	But	she
doesn’t	push	it.	“That’s	good	to	hear.	Sharing	experiences	with	other
kids	whose	parents	are	struggling	would	be	transformative	for	you.”

Officer	Lopez	doesn’t	let	up.	You	have	to	give	her	that.	We	could
be	surrounded	by	walking	dead	in	the	zombie	apocalypse	and	she’d
look	for	the	bright	side.	 _Your	brains	are	still	in	your	head,	right?	Way
to	beat	the	odds!_ 	She’d	love,	just	once,	to	hear	an	actual	positive	thing
from	 me.	 Like	 how	 I	 spent	 Friday	 night	 with	 Ivy	 League–bound
Bronwyn	 Rojas	 and	 didn’t	 disgrace	 myself.	 But	 that’s	 not	 a
conversation	I	need	to	open	up	with	Officer	Lopez.

I	don’t	know	why	I	showed	up	there.	I	was	restless,	staring	at	the
Vicodin	I	had	left	over	after	drop-off	and	wondering	if	I	should	take	a
few	and	see	what	all	the	fuss	is	about.	I’ve	never	gone	down	that	road,
because	I’m	pretty	sure	it’d	end	with	me	comatose	in	the	living	room
alongside	 my	 dad	 until	 someone	 kicked	 us	 out	 for	 not	 paying	 the
mortgage.


So	 I	 went	 to	 Bronwyn’s	 instead.	 I	 didn’t	 expect	 her	 to	 come
outside.	Or	invite	me	in.	Listening	to	her	play	the	piano	had	a	strange
effect	on	me.	I	almost	felt...peaceful.

“How	is	everyone	coping	with	Simon’s	death?	Have	they	held	the
funeral	yet?”

“It’s	today.	The	school	sent	an	email.”	I	glance	at	the	clock	on	our
microwave.	“In	about	half	an	hour.”

Her	 brows	 shoot	 up.	 “Nate.	 You	 should	 go.	 That	 would	 be	 a
positive	 thing	 to	 do.	 Pay	 your	 respects,	 gain	 some	 closure	 after	 a
traumatic	event.”

“No	thanks.”
She	clears	her	throat	and	gives	me	a	shrewd	look.	“Let	me	put	it
another	way.	Go	to	that	goddamn	funeral,	Nate	Macauley,	or	I	won’t
overlook	your	spotty	school	attendance	the	next	time	I	file	an	update
report.	I’ll	come	with	you.”

Which	 is	 how	 I	 end	 up	 at	 Simon	 Kelleher’s	 funeral	 with	 my
probation	officer.

We’re	late	and	St.	Anthony’s	Church	is	packed,	so	we	barely	find
space	in	the	last	pew.	The	service	hasn’t	started	but	no	one’s	talking,
and	when	the	old	guy	in	front	of	us	coughs	it	echoes	through	the	room.
The	smell	of	incense	brings	me	back	to	grade	school,	when	my	mother
used	to	take	me	to	Mass	every	Sunday.	I	haven’t	been	to	church	since
then,	but	it	looks	almost	exactly	the	same:	red	carpet,	shiny	dark	wood,
tall	stained-glass	windows.

The	only	thing	that’s	different	is	the	place	is	crawling	with	cops.
Not	in	uniform.	But	I	can	tell,	and	Officer	Lopez	can	too.	After	a
while	some	of	them	look	my	way,	and	I	get	paranoid	she’s	led	me	into
some	kind	of	trap.	But	I	don’t	have	anything	on	me.	So	why	do	they
keep	staring	at	me?

Not	only	me.	I	follow	their	gazes	to	Bronwyn,	who’s	near	the	front
with	 her	 parents,	 and	 to	 Cooper	 and	 the	 blond	 girl,	 sitting	 in	 the
middle	with	their	friends.	The	back	of	my	neck	tingles,	and	not	in	a
good	way.	My	body	tenses,	ready	to	bolt	until	Officer	Lopez	puts	a
hand	on	my	arm.	She	doesn’t	say	anything,	but	I	stay	put.

```
A	bunch	of	people	talk—nobody	I	know	except	that	Goth	girl	who
```

used	to	follow	Simon	everywhere.	She	reads	a	weird,	rambling	poem
and	her	voice	shakes	the	whole	time.

```
The	past	and	present	wilt—I	have	fill’d	them,	emptied
them,
And	proceed	to	fill	my	next	fold	of	the	future.
Listener	up	there!	what	have	you	to	confide	to	me?
Look	in	my	face	while	I	snuff	the	sidle	of	evening,
(Talk	honestly,	no	one	else	hears	you,	and	I	stay	only	a
minute	longer.)
Do	I	contradict	myself?
Very	well	then	I	contradict	myself,
(I	am	large,	I	contain	multitudes.)...
Will	you	speak	before	I	am	gone?	will	you	prove	already	too
late?...
I	depart	as	air,	I	shake	my	white	locks	at	the	runaway	sun,
I	effuse	my	flesh	in	eddies,	and	drift	it	in	lacy	jags.
I	bequeath	myself	to	the	dirt	to	grow	from	the	grass	I	love,
If	you	want	me	again	look	for	me	under	your	boot-soles.
You	will	hardly	know	who	I	am	or	what	I	mean,
But	I	shall	be	good	health	to	you	nevertheless,
And	filter	and	fiber	your	blood.
Failing	to	fetch	me	at	first	keep	encouraged,
Missing	me	one	place	search	another,
I	stop	somewhere	waiting	for	you.
```
_“Song	of	Myself,”_ 	Officer	Lopez	murmurs	when	the	girl	finishes.
“Interesting	choice.”

There’s	music,	more	readings,	and	it’s	finally	over.	The	priest	tells
us	the	burial’s	going	to	be	private,	family	only.	Fine	by	me.	I’ve	never
wanted	to	leave	anyplace	so	bad	in	my	life	and	I’m	ready	to	take	off
before	the	funeral	procession	comes	down	the	aisle,	but	Officer	Lopez


has	her	hand	on	my	arm	again.

A	bunch	of	senior	guys	carry	Simon’s	casket	out	the	door.	A	couple
dozen	people	dressed	in	dark	colors	file	out	after	them,	ending	with	a
man	and	a	woman	holding	hands.	The	woman	has	a	thin,	angular	face
like	Simon.	She’s	staring	at	the	floor,	but	as	she	passes	our	pew	she
looks	up,	catches	my	eye,	and	chokes	out	a	furious	sob.

More	people	crowd	the	aisles,	and	someone	edges	into	the	pew
with	Officer	Lopez	and	me.	It’s	one	of	the	plainclothes	cops,	an	older
guy	with	a	buzz	cut.	I	can	tell	right	away	he’s	not	bush-league	like
Officer	Budapest.	He	smiles	like	we’ve	met	before.

```
“Nate	Macauley?”	he	asks.	“You	got	a	few	minutes,	son?”
```

**Addy**

**Sunday,	September	30,	2:05	p.m.**

I	 shade	 my	 eyes	 against	 the	 sun	 outside	 the	 church,	 scanning	 the
crowd	 until	 I	 spot	 Jake.	 He	 and	 the	 other	 pallbearers	 put	 Simon’s
casket	onto	some	kind	of	metal	stretcher,	then	step	aside	as	the	funeral
directors	angle	it	toward	the	hearse.	I	look	down,	not	wanting	to	watch
Simon’s	 body	 get	 loaded	 into	 the	 back	 of	 a	 car	 like	 an	 oversized
suitcase,	and	somebody	taps	me	on	the	shoulder.

“Addy	Prentiss?”	An	older	woman	dressed	in	a	boxy	blue	suit	gives
me	a	polite,	professional	smile.	“I’m	Detective	Laura	Wheeler	with	the
Bayview	Police.	I	want	to	follow	up	on	the	discussion	you	had	last	week
with	Officer	Budapest	about	Simon	Kelleher’s	death.	Could	you	come
to	the	station	with	me	for	a	few	minutes?”

I	stare	at	her	and	lick	my	lips.	I	want	to	ask	why,	but	she’s	so	calm
and	assured,	like	it’s	the	most	natural	thing	in	the	world	to	pull	me
aside	after	a	funeral,	that	it	seems	rude	to	question	her.	Jake	comes	up
beside	me	then,	handsome	in	his	suit,	and	gives	Detective	Wheeler	a
friendly,	curious	smile.	My	eyes	dart	between	them	and	I	stammer,
“Isn’t	it—I	mean—can’t	we	talk	here?”

Detective	 Wheeler	 winces.	 “So	 crowded,	 don’t	 you	 think?	 And
we’re	right	around	the	corner.”	She	gives	Jake	a	half	smile.	“Detective
Laura	Wheeler,	Bayview	Police.	I’m	looking	to	borrow	Addy	for	a	little
while	and	get	clarification	on	a	few	points	related	to	Simon	Kelleher’s
death.”

“Sure,”	he	says,	like	that	settles	things.	“Text	me	if	you	need	a	ride
after,	Ads.	Luis	and	I	will	stick	around	downtown.	We’re	starving	and
we	gotta	talk	offensive	strategy	for	next	Saturday’s	game.	Going	to
Glenn’s,	probably.”

So	 that’s	 it,	 I	 guess.	 I	 follow	 Detective	 Wheeler	 down	 the
cobblestone	path	behind	the	church	that	leads	to	the	sidewalk,	even


though	I	don’t	want	to.	Maybe	this	is	what	Ashton	means	when	she
says	I	don’t	think	for	myself.	It’s	three	blocks	to	the	police	station,	and
we	walk	in	silence	past	a	hardware	store,	the	post	office,	and	an	ice
cream	parlor	where	a	little	girl	out	front	is	having	a	meltdown	about
getting	chocolate	sprinkles	instead	of	rainbow.	I	keep	thinking	I	should
tell	 Detective	 Wheeler	 that	 my	 mother	 will	 worry	 if	 I	 don’t	 come
straight	home,	but	I’m	not	sure	I	could	say	it	without	laughing.

We	pass	through	metal	detectors	in	the	front	of	the	police	station
and	Detective	Wheeler	leads	me	straight	to	the	back	and	into	a	small,
overheated	room.	I’ve	never	been	inside	a	police	station	before,	and	I
thought	it	would	be	more...I	don’t	know.	Official-looking.	It	reminds
me	 of	 the	 conference	 room	 in	 Principal	 Gupta’s	 office,	 with	 worse
lighting.	The	flickering	fluorescent	tube	above	us	deepens	every	line	on
Detective	Wheeler’s	face	and	turns	her	skin	an	unattractive	yellow.	I
wonder	what	it	does	to	mine.

She	offers	me	a	drink,	and	when	I	decline	she	leaves	the	room	for
a	few	minutes,	returning	with	a	messenger	bag	slung	over	one	shoulder
and	a	small,	dark-haired	woman	trailing	behind	her.	Both	of	them	sit
across	from	me	at	the	squat	metal	table,	and	Detective	Wheeler	lowers
her	bag	onto	the	floor.	“Addy,	this	is	Lorna	Shaloub,	a	family	liaison	for
the	Bayview	School	District.	She’s	here	as	an	interested	adult	on	your
behalf.	Now,	this	is	not	a	custodial	interrogation.	You	don’t	have	to
answer	my	questions	and	you	are	free	to	leave	at	any	time.	Do	you
understand?”

Not	really.	She	lost	me	at	“interested	adult.”	But	I	say	“Sure,”	even
though	I	wish	more	than	ever	I’d	just	gone	home.	Or	that	Jake	had
come	with	me.

“Good.	I	hope	you’ll	hang	in	here	with	me.	My	sense	is,	of	all	the
kids	involved,	you’re	the	most	likely	to	have	gotten	in	over	your	head
with	no	ill	intent.”

I	blink	at	her.	“No	ill	what?”
“No	ill	intent.	I	want	to	show	you	something.”	She	reaches	into	the
bag	next	to	her	and	pulls	out	a	laptop.	Ms.	Shaloub	and	I	wait	as	she
opens	it	and	presses	a	few	keys.	I	suck	in	my	cheeks,	wondering	if	she’s
going	to	show	me	the	Tumblr	posts.	Maybe	the	police	think	one	of	us
wrote	them	as	some	kind	of	awful	joke.	If	they	ask	me	who,	I	guess	I’d
have	to	say	Bronwyn.	Because	the	whole	thing	sounds	like	it’s	written


by	somebody	who	thinks	they’re	ten	times	smarter	than	everyone	else.

Detective	Wheeler	turns	the	laptop	so	it’s	facing	me.	I’m	not	sure
what	I’m	looking	at,	but	it	seems	like	some	kind	of	blog,	with	the	About
That	logo	front	and	center.	I	give	her	a	questioning	look,	and	she	says,
“This	is	the	admin	panel	Simon	used	to	manage	content	for	About
That.	The	text	below	last	Monday’s	date	stamp	are	his	latest	posts.”

```
I	lean	forward	and	start	to	read.
```
```
First	time	this	app	has	ever	featured	good-girl	BR,	possessor	of	school’s	most
perfect	academic	record.	Except	she	didn’t	get	that	A	in	chemistry	through	plain
old	hard	work,	unless	that’s	how	you	define	stealing	tests	from	Mr.	C’s	Google
Drive.	Someone	call	Yale....
On	the	opposite	end	of	the	spectrum,	our	favorite	criminal	NM’s	back	to
doing	what	he	does	best:	making	sure	the	entire	school	is	as	high	as	it	wants	to
be.	Pretty	sure	that’s	a	probation	violation	there,	N.
MLB	plus	CC	equals	a	whole	lot	of	green	next	June,	right?	Seems
inevitable	Bayview’s	southpaw	will	make	a	splash	in	the	major	leagues...but
don’t	they	have	some	pretty	strict	antijuicing	rules?	Because	CC’s	performance
was	most	definitely	enhanced	during	showcase	season.
AP	and	JR	are	the	perfect	couple.	Homecoming	princess	and	star	running
back,	in	love	for	three	years	straight.	Except	for	that	intimate	detour	A	took	over
the	summer	with	TF	at	his	beach	house.	Even	more	awkward	now	that	the
guys	are	friends.	Think	they	compare	notes?
```
I	can’t	breathe.	It’s	out	there	for	everyone	to	see.	How?	Simon’s
dead;	he	can’t	have	published	this.	Has	someone	else	taken	over	for
him?	The	Tumblr	poster?	But	it	doesn’t	even	matter:	the	how,	the	why,
the	when—all	that	matters	is	that	it	 _is._ 	Jake	will	see	it,	if	he	hasn’t
already.	All	the	things	I	read	before	I	got	to	my	initials,	that	shocked
me	as	I	realized	who	they	were	about	and	what	they	meant,	fall	out	of
my	brain.	Nothing	exists	except	my	stupid,	horrible	mistake	in	black
and	white	on	the	screen	for	the	whole	world	to	read.

Jake	will	 _know._ 	And	he’ll	never	forgive	me.
I’m	almost	folded	in	half	with	my	head	on	the	table,	and	can’t
make	out	Detective	Wheeler’s	words	at	first.	Then	some	start	breaking
through.	“...can	understand	how	you	felt	trapped...keep	this	from	being
published...If	you	tell	us	what	happened	we	can	help	you,	Addy....”

Only	one	phrase	sinks	in.	“Is	this	not	published?”
“It	was	queued	up	the	day	Simon	died,	but	he	never	got	the	chance
to	post	it,”	Detective	Wheeler	says	calmly.


_Salvation._ 	Jake	hasn’t	seen	this.	Nobody	has.	Except...this	police
officer,	and	maybe	other	police	officers.	What	I’m	focused	on	and	what
she’s	focused	on	are	two	different	things.

Detective	Wheeler	leans	forward,	her	lips	stretched	in	a	smile	that
doesn’t	reach	her	eyes.	“You	may	already	have	recognized	the	initials,
but	those	other	stories	were	about	Bronwyn	Rojas,	Nate	Macauley,	and
Cooper	Clay.	The	four	of	you	who	were	in	the	room	with	Simon	when
he	died.”

“That’s...a	weird	coincidence,”	I	manage.
“Isn’t	it?”	Detective	Wheeler	agrees.	“Addy,	you	already	know	how
Simon	died.	We’ve	analyzed	Mr.	Avery’s	room	and	can’t	see	any	way
that	peanut	oil	could	have	gotten	into	Simon’s	cup	unless	someone	put
it	there	after	he	filled	it	from	the	tap.	There	were	only	six	people	in	the
room,	one	of	whom	is	dead.	Your	teacher	left	for	a	long	period	of	time.
The	four	of	you	who	remained	with	Simon	all	had	reasons	for	wanting
to	keep	him	quiet.”	Her	voice	doesn’t	get	any	louder,	but	it	fills	my	ears
like	buzzing	from	a	hive.	“Do	you	see	where	I’m	heading	with	this?
This	might	have	been	carried	out	as	a	group,	but	it	doesn’t	mean	you
share	equal	responsibility.	There’s	a	big	difference	between	coming	up
with	an	idea	and	going	along	with	it.”

I	look	at	Ms.	Shaloub.	She	does	look	 _interested,_ 	I	have	to	say,	but
not	like	she’s	on	my	side.	“I	don’t	understand	what	you	mean.”

“You	lied	about	being	in	the	nurse’s	office,	Addy.	Did	someone	put
you	up	to	that?	To	removing	the	EpiPens	so	Simon	couldn’t	be	helped
later?”

My	heart	pounds	as	I	pull	a	strand	of	hair	off	my	shoulders	and
twist	it	around	my	fingers.	“I	didn’t	lie.	I	forgot.”	God,	what	if	she
makes	me	take	a	lie	detector	test?	I’ll	never	pass.

“Kids	 your	 age	 are	 under	 a	 lot	 of	 pressure	 today,”	 Detective
Wheeler	says.	Her	tone	is	almost	friendly,	but	her	eyes	are	as	flat	as
ever.	 “The	 social	 media	 alone—it’s	 like	 you	 can’t	 make	 a	 mistake
anymore,	 can	 you?	 It	 follows	 you	 everywhere.	 The	 court	 is	 very
forgiving	toward	impressionable	young	people	who	act	hastily	when
they	have	a	lot	to	lose,	especially	when	they	help	us	uncover	the	truth.
Simon’s	family	deserves	the	truth,	don’t	you	think?”

I	hunch	my	shoulders	and	tug	at	my	hair.	I	don’t	know	what	to	do.
Jake	would	know—but	Jake’s	not	here.	I	look	at	Ms.	Shaloub	tucking


her	short	hair	behind	her	ears,	and	suddenly	Ashton’s	voice	pops	into
my	head.	 _You	don’t	have	to	answer	any	questions._

_Right._ 	Detective	Wheeler	said	that	at	the	beginning,	and	the	words
push	everything	else	out	of	my	brain	with	startling	relief	and	clarity.

“I’m	going	to	leave	now.”
I	say	it	with	confidence,	but	I’m	still	not	one	hundred	percent	sure
I	can	do	that.	I	stand	and	wait	for	her	to	stop	me,	but	she	doesn’t.	She
just	narrows	her	eyes	and	says,	“Of	course.	As	I	told	you,	this	isn’t	a
custodial	interrogation.	But	please	understand,	the	help	I	can	give	you
now	won’t	be	the	same	once	you	leave	this	room.”

“I	don’t	need	your	help,”	I	tell	her,	and	walk	out	the	door,	then	out
of	the	police	station.	Nobody	stops	me.	Once	I’m	outside,	though,	I
don’t	know	where	to	go	or	what	to	do.

I	sit	on	a	bench	and	pull	out	my	phone,	my	hands	shaking.	I	can’t
call	Jake,	not	for	this.	But	who	does	that	leave?	My	mind’s	as	blank	as
if	Detective	Wheeler	took	an	eraser	and	wiped	it	clean.	I’ve	built	my
entire	world	around	Jake	and	now	that	it’s	shattered	I	realize,	way	too
late,	that	I	should	have	cultivated	some	other	people	who’d	care	that	a
police	officer	with	mom	hair	and	a	sensible	suit	just	accused	me	of
murder.	And	when	I	say	“care,”	I	don’t	mean	in	an	 _oh-my-God-did-
you-hear-what-happened-to-Addy_ 	kind	of	way.

My	 mother	 would	 care,	 but	 I	 can’t	 face	 that	 much	 scorn	 and
judgment	right	now.

I	scroll	to	the	 _A_ s	in	my	contact	list	and	press	a	name.	It’s	my	only
option,	and	I	say	a	silent	prayer	of	thanks	when	she	picks	up.

“Ash?”	Somehow	I	manage	not	to	cry	at	my	sister’s	voice.	“I	need
help.”

**Cooper**

**Sunday,	September	30,	2:30	p.m.**

When	 Detective	 Chang	 shows	 me	 Simon’s	 unpublished	 About	 That
page,	I	read	everyone	else’s	entry	first.	Bronwyn’s	shocks	me,	Nate’s
doesn’t,	I	have	no	idea	who	the	hell	this	“TF”	Addy	supposedly	hooked
up	with	is—and	I’m	almost	positive	I	know	what’s	coming	for	me.	My
heart	pounds	as	I	spy	my	initials:	 _Because	CC’s	performance	was	most
definitely	enhanced	during	showcase	season._


Huh.	My	pulse	slows	as	I	lean	back	in	my	chair.	That’s	not	what	I
expected.

Although	I	guess	I	shouldn’t	be	surprised.	I	improved	too	much,
too	quickly—even	the	Padres	scout	said	something.

Detective	Chang	dances	around	the	subject	for	a	while,	dropping
hints	until	I	understand	he	thinks	the	four	of	us	who	were	in	the	room
planned	the	whole	thing	to	keep	Simon	from	posting	his	update.	I	try
to	picture	it—me,	Nate,	and	the	two	girls	plotting	murder	by	peanut	oil
in	Mr.	Avery’s	detention.	It’s	so	stupid	it	wouldn’t	even	make	a	good
movie.

I	know	I’m	quiet	for	too	long.	“Nate	and	I	never	even	spoke	before
last	week,”	I	finally	say.	“And	I	sure	as	heck	never	talked	to	the	girls
about	this.”

Detective	Chang	leans	almost	halfway	across	the	table.	“You’re	a
good	kid,	Cooper.	Your	record’s	spotless	till	now,	and	you’ve	got	a
bright	future.	You	made	one	mistake	and	you	got	caught.	That’s	scary.
I	get	that.	But	it’s	not	too	late	to	do	the	right	thing.”

I’m	not	sure	which	mistake	he’s	referring	to:	my	alleged	juicing,
my	alleged	murdering,	or	something	we	haven’t	talked	about	yet.	But
as	 far	 as	 I	 know,	 I	 haven’t	 been	 _caught_ at	 anything.	 Just	 accused.
Bronwyn	 and	 Addy	 are	 probably	 getting	 the	 exact	 same	 speech
somewhere.	I	guess	Nate	would	get	a	different	one.

“I	didn’t	cheat,”	I	tell	Detective	Chang.	“And	I	didn’t	hurt	Simon.”
_Ah	didn’t._ 	I	can	hear	my	accent	coming	back.

He	tries	a	different	tack.	“Whose	idea	was	it	to	use	the	planted	cell
phones	to	get	all	of	you	into	detention	together?”

I	lean	forward,	palms	pressed	on	the	black	wool	of	my	good	pants.
I	hardly	ever	wear	them,	and	they’re	making	me	hot	and	itchy.	My
heart’s	banging	against	my	chest	again.	“Listen.	I	don’t	know	who	did
that,	but...isn’t	it	something	you	should	look	into?	Like,	were	there
fingerprints	on	the	phones?	Because	it	feels	to	me	like	maybe	we	were
framed.”	The	other	guy	in	the	room,	some	representative	from	the
Bayview	School	District	who	hasn’t	said	a	word,	nods	like	I’ve	said
something	profound.	But	Detective	Chang’s	expression	doesn’t	change.

“Cooper,	 we	 examined	 those	 phones	 as	 soon	 as	 we	 started	 to
suspect	foul	play.	There’s	no	forensic	evidence	to	suggest	anyone	else


was	involved.	Our	focus	is	on	the	four	of	you,	and	that’s	where	I	expect
it	to	remain.”

Which	finally	gets	me	to	say,	“I	want	to	call	my	parents.”
The	“want”	part	isn’t	true,	but	I’m	in	over	my	head.	Detective
Chang	heaves	a	sigh	like	I’ve	disappointed	him	but	says,	“All	right.	You
have	your	cell	phone	with	you?”	When	I	nod,	he	says,	“You	can	make
the	call	here.”	He	stays	in	the	room	while	I	call	Pop,	who	catches	on	a
lot	faster	than	I	did.

“Give	me	that	detective	you’re	talking	to,”	he	spits.	“Right	now.
And	 Cooperstown—wait,	 Cooper!	 Hold	 up.	 Don’t	 you	 say	 another
goddamn	word	to	 _anyone._ ”

I	hand	Detective	Chang	my	phone	and	he	puts	it	to	his	ear.	I	can’t
hear	everything	Pop’s	saying,	but	he’s	loud	enough	that	I	get	the	basic
idea.	Detective	Chang	tries	to	insert	a	few	words—along	the	lines	of
how	it’s	perfectly	legal	to	question	minors	in	California	without	their
parents	present—but	mostly	he	lets	Pop	rant.	At	one	point	he	says,
“No.	He’s	free	to	go,”	and	my	ears	prick	up.	It	hadn’t	occurred	to	me
that	I	could	 _leave._

Detective	Chang	gives	my	phone	back,	and	Pop’s	voice	crackles	in
my	ear.	“Cooper,	you	there?	Get	your	ass	home.	They’re	not	charging
you	with	anything,	and	you’re	not	gonna	answer	any	more	questions
without	me	and	a	lawyer.”

_A	lawyer._ 	Do	I	actually	need	one	of	those?	I	hang	up	and	face
Detective	Chang.	“My	father	told	me	to	leave.”

“You	have	that	right,”	Detective	Chang	says,	and	I	wish	I’d	known
that	from	the	beginning.	Maybe	he	told	me.	I	honestly	don’t	remember.
“But,	Cooper,	these	conversations	are	happening	all	over	the	station
with	your	friends.	One	of	them	is	going	to	agree	to	work	with	us,	and
that	person	will	be	treated	very	differently	from	the	rest	of	you.	I	think
it	should	be	you.	I’d	like	you	to	have	that	chance.”

I	want	to	tell	him	he’s	got	it	all	wrong,	but	Pop	told	me	to	stop
talking.	I	can’t	bring	myself	to	leave	without	saying	anything,	though.
So	I	end	up	shaking	Detective	Chang’s	hand	and	saying,	“Thank	you
for	your	time,	sir.”

I	sound	like	the	ass-kisser	of	the	century.	It’s	years	of	conditioning
kicking	in.


**Bronwyn**

**Sunday,	September	30,	3:07	p.m.**

I’m	 beyond	 grateful	 my	 parents	 were	 with	 me	 at	 church	 when
Detective	Mendoza	pulled	me	aside	and	asked	me	to	come	to	the	police
station.	I	thought	I’d	just	get	a	few	follow-up	questions	from	Officer
Budapest.	I	wasn’t	prepared	for	what	came	next	and	wouldn’t	have
known	what	to	do.	My	parents	took	over	and	refused	to	let	me	answer
his	questions.	They	got	tons	of	information	out	of	the	detective	and
didn’t	give	up	anything	in	return.	It	was	pretty	masterful.

But.	Now	they	know	what	I’ve	done.
Well.	Not	yet.	They	know	the	rumor.	At	the	moment,	driving	home
from	the	police	station,	they’re	still	ranting	against	the	injustice	of	it
all.	My	mother	is,	anyway.	My	father’s	keeping	his	attention	on	the
road,	but	even	his	turn	signals	are	unusually	aggressive.

“I	mean,”	my	mother	says,	in	an	urgent	voice	that	indicates	she’s
barely	warming	up,	“it’s	horrible	what	happened	to	Simon.	Of	course
his	parents	want	answers.	But	to	take	a	high	school	gossip	post	and
turn	it	into	an	accusation	like	that	is	just	ludicrous.	I	can’t	fathom	how
anyone	could	think	Bronwyn	would	 _kill_ 	a	boy	because	he	was	about	to
post	a	lie.”

“It’s	not	a	lie,”	I	say,	but	too	quietly	for	her	to	hear	me.
“The	police	have	nothing.”	My	father	sounds	like	he’s	judging	a
company	 he’s	 thinking	 of	 acquiring	 and	 finds	 it	 lacking.	 “Flimsy
circumstantial	evidence.	Obviously	no	real	forensics	or	they	wouldn’t
be	reaching	this	way.	That	was	a	Hail	Mary.”	The	car	in	front	of	us
stops	short	at	a	yellow	light,	and	Dad	swears	softly	in	Spanish	as	he
brakes.	“Bronwyn,	I	don’t	want	you	to	worry	about	this.	We’ll	hire	an
outstanding	lawyer,	but	it’s	purely	a	formality.	I	may	sue	the	police
department	when	it’s	all	over.	Especially	if	any	of	this	goes	public	and
harms	your	reputation.”


My	 throat	 feels	 like	 I’m	 getting	 ready	 to	 push	 words	 through
sludge.	“I	did.”	I’m	barely	audible.	I	press	the	palm	of	my	hand	to	my
burning	cheek	and	force	my	voice	higher.	“I	did	cheat.	I’m	sorry.”

Mom	rotates	in	her	seat.	“I	can’t	hear	you,	honey.	What	was	that?”
“I	cheated.”	The	words	tumble	out	of	me:	how	I’d	used	a	computer
in	the	lab	right	after	Mr.	Camino,	and	realized	he	hadn’t	logged	out	of
his	Google	Drive.	A	file	with	all	our	chemistry	test	questions	for	the
rest	of	the	year	was	right	there.	I	downloaded	it	onto	a	flash	drive
almost	without	thinking	about	it.	And	I	used	it	to	get	perfect	scores	for
the	rest	of	the	year.

I	have	no	idea	how	Simon	found	out.	But	as	usual,	he	was	right.
The	next	few	minutes	in	the	car	are	horrible.	Mom	turns	in	her
seat	and	stares	at	me	with	betrayal	in	her	eyes.	Dad	can’t	do	the	same,
but	he	keeps	glancing	into	the	rearview	mirror	like	he’s	hoping	to	see
something	 different.	 I	 can	 read	 the	 hurt	 in	 both	 their	 expressions:
_You’re	not	who	we	thought	you	were._

My	parents	are	all	about	merit-based	achievement.	Dad	was	one	of
the	youngest	CFOs	in	California	before	we	were	even	born,	and	Mom’s
dermatology	practice	is	so	successful	she	hasn’t	been	able	to	take	on
any	new	patients	in	years.	They’ve	been	drumming	the	same	message
into	me	since	kindergarten:	 _Work	hard,	do	your	best,	and	the	rest	will
follow._ 	And	it	always	had,	until	chemistry.

I	guess	I	didn’t	know	what	to	do	about	that.
“Bronwyn.”	Mom’s	still	staring	at	me,	her	voice	low	and	tight.	“My
God.	I	never	would	have	imagined	you’d	do	something	like	that.	This	is
terrible	on	so	many	levels,	but	most	important,	it	gives	you	a	motive.”

“I	didn’t	do	anything	to	Simon!”	I	burst	out.
The	hard	lines	of	her	mouth	soften	slightly	as	she	shakes	her	head
at	me.	“I’m	disappointed	in	you,	Bronwyn,	but	I	didn’t	make	 _that_ 	leap.
I’m	just	stating	fact.	If	you	can’t	unequivocally	say	that	Simon	was
lying,	this	could	get	very	messy.”	She	rubs	a	hand	over	her	eyes.	“How
did	he	know	you	cheated?	Does	he	have	proof?”

“I	 don’t	 know.	 Simon	 didn’t...”	 I	 pause,	 thinking	 about	 all	 the
About	That	updates	I’d	read	over	the	years.	“Simon	never	really	 _proved_
anything.	 It’s	 just...everybody	 believed	 him	 because	 he	 was	 never
wrong.	Things	always	came	out	eventually.”


And	 here	 I’d	 thought	 I	 was	 in	 the	 clear,	 since	 I’d	 taken	 Mr.
Camino’s	files	last	March.	What	I	just	don’t	get	is,	if	Simon	had	known,
why	hadn’t	he	pounced	on	it	right	away?

I	knew	what	I	did	was	wrong,	obviously.	I	even	thought	it	might	be
illegal,	although	technically	I	didn’t	break	into	Mr.	Camino’s	account
since	it	was	already	open.	But	that	part	hardly	seemed	real.	Maeve	uses
her	mad	computer	skills	to	hack	into	stuff	for	fun	all	the	time,	and	if	I’d
thought	of	it	I	probably	could	have	asked	her	to	get	Mr.	Camino’s	files
for	me.	Or	even	change	my	grade.	But	it	wasn’t	premeditated.	The	file
was	in	front	of	me	in	that	moment,	and	I	took	it.

Then	I	chose	to	use	it	for	months	afterward,	telling	myself	it	was
okay	because	one	hard	class	shouldn’t	ruin	my	whole	future.	Which	is
kind	of	horribly	ironic,	given	what	just	happened	at	the	police	station.

I	wonder	if	everything	Simon	wrote	about	Cooper	and	Addy	is	true
too.	 Detective	 Mendoza	 showed	 us	 all	 the	 entries,	 implying	 that
somebody	else	might	already	be	confessing	and	cutting	a	deal.	I	always
thought	Cooper’s	talent	was	God-given	and	that	Addy	was	too	Jake-
obsessed	 to	 even	 look	 at	 another	 guy,	 but	 they	 probably	 never
imagined	me	as	a	cheater,	either.

With	Nate,	I	don’t	wonder.	He’s	never	pretended	to	be	anything
other	than	exactly	who	he	is.

Dad	pulls	into	our	driveway	and	cuts	the	engine,	slipping	the	keys
from	the	ignition	and	turning	to	face	me.	“Is	there	anything	else	you
haven’t	told	us?”

I	think	back	to	the	claustrophobic	little	room	at	the	police	station,
my	 parents	 on	 either	 side	 of	 me	 as	 Detective	 Mendoza	 lobbed
questions	like	grenades.	 _Were	you	competitive	with	Simon?	Have	you
ever	been	to	his	house?	Did	you	know	he	was	writing	a	post	about
you?_

_Did	you	have	any	reason,	beyond	this,	to	dislike	or	resent	Simon?_
My	parents	said	I	didn’t	have	to	respond	to	any	of	his	questions,
but	I	did	answer	that	one.	 _No,_ 	I	said	then.

```
“No,”	I	say	now,	meeting	my	father’s	eyes.
If	he	knows	I’m	lying,	he	doesn’t	show	it.
```
**Nate**


**Sunday,	September	30,	5:15	p.m.**

Calling	my	ride	home	with	Officer	Lopez	after	Simon’s	funeral	“tense”
would	be	an	understatement.

It	 was	 hours	 later,	 for	 one	 thing.	 After	 Officer	 Buzz	 Cut	 had
brought	me	to	the	station	and	asked	me	a	half-dozen	different	ways
whether	 I’d	 killed	 Simon.	 Officer	 Lopez	 had	 asked	 if	 she	 could	 be
present	during	questioning,	and	he	agreed,	which	was	fine	with	me.
Although	things	got	a	little	awkward	when	he	pulled	up	Simon’s	drug-
dealing	accusation.

Which,	although	true,	he	can’t	prove.	Even	I	know	that.	I	stayed
calm	when	he	told	me	the	circumstances	surrounding	Simon’s	death
gave	the	police	probable	cause	to	search	my	house	for	drugs,	and	that
they	already	had	a	warrant.	I’d	cleared	everything	out	this	morning,	so
I	knew	they	wouldn’t	find	anything.

Thank	God	Officer	Lopez	and	I	meet	on	Sundays.	I’d	probably	be
in	 jail	 otherwise.	 I	 owe	 her	 big-time	 for	 that,	 although	 she	 doesn’t
know	it.	And	for	having	my	back	during	questioning,	which	I	didn’t
expect.	I’ve	lied	to	her	face	every	time	we’ve	met	and	I’m	pretty	sure
she	 knows	 that.	 But	 when	 Officer	 Buzz	 Cut	 started	 getting	 heated,
she’d	dial	him	back.	I	got	the	sense,	eventually,	that	all	they	have	is
some	flimsy	circumstantial	evidence	and	a	theory	they	were	hoping	to
pressure	someone	into	admitting.

I	answered	a	few	of	their	questions.	The	ones	I	knew	couldn’t	get
me	into	trouble.	Everything	else	was	some	variation	of	 _I	don’t	know_
and	 _I	don’t	remember._ 	Sometimes	it	was	even	true.

Officer	Lopez	didn’t	say	a	word	from	the	time	we	left	the	police
station	until	she	pulled	into	my	driveway.	Now	she	gives	me	a	look	that
makes	it	clear	even	she	can’t	find	a	bright	side	to	what	just	happened.

“Nate.	 I	 won’t	 ask	 if	 what	 I	 saw	 on	 that	 site	 is	 true.	 That’s	 a
conversation	for	you	and	a	lawyer	if	it	ever	comes	to	that.	But	you	need
to	understand	something.	If,	from	this	day	forward,	you	deal	drugs	in
any	way,	shape,	or	form— _I	can’t	help	you._ 	Nobody	can.	This	is	no	joke.
You’re	 dealing	 with	 a	 potential	 capital	 offense.	 There	 are	 four	 kids
involved	in	this	investigation	and	every	single	one	of	them	 _except	you_
is	backed	by	parents	who	are	materially	comfortable	and	present	in
their	children’s	lives.	If	not	outright	wealthy	and	influential.	You’re	the
obvious	outlier	and	scapegoat.	Am	I	making	myself	clear?”


Jesus.	She’s	not	pulling	any	punches.	“Yeah.”	I	got	it.	I’d	been
thinking	about	it	all	the	way	home.

“All	right.	I’ll	see	you	next	Sunday.	Call	me	if	you	need	me	before
then.”

I	climb	out	of	the	car	without	thanking	her.	It’s	a	bullshit	move,
but	I	don’t	have	it	in	me	to	be	grateful.	I	step	inside	our	low-ceilinged
kitchen	and	the	smell	hits	me	right	away:	stale	vomit	seeps	into	my
nose	and	throat,	making	me	gag.	I	look	around	for	the	source,	and	I
guess	today’s	my	lucky	day	because	my	father	managed	to	make	it	to
the	sink.	He	just	didn’t	bother	rinsing	it	afterward.	I	put	one	hand	over
my	face	and	use	the	other	to	aim	a	spray	of	water,	but	it’s	no	good.	The
stuff’s	caked	on	by	now	and	it	won’t	come	off	unless	I	scrub	it.

We	have	a	sponge	somewhere.	Probably	in	the	cabinet	under	the
sink.	Instead	of	looking,	though,	I	kick	it.	Which	is	pretty	satisfying,	so
I	do	it	another	five	or	ten	times,	harder	and	harder	until	the	cheap
wood	splinters	and	cracks.	I’m	panting,	breathing	in	lungsful	of	puke-
infested	air,	and	I’m	so	fucking	sick	of	it	all,	I	could	kill	somebody.

Some	people	are	too	toxic	to	live.	They	just	are.
A	familiar	scratching	sound	comes	from	the	living	room—Stan,
clawing	at	the	glass	of	his	terrarium,	looking	for	food.	I	squirt	half	a
bottle	of	dish	detergent	in	the	sink	and	aim	another	blast	of	water	over
it.	I’ll	deal	with	the	rest	later.

I	get	a	container	of	live	crickets	from	the	refrigerator	and	drop
them	into	Stan’s	cage,	watching	them	hop	around	with	no	clue	what’s
in	store	for	them.	My	breathing	slows	and	my	head	clears,	but	that’s
not	exactly	good	news.	If	I’m	not	thinking	about	one	shit	storm,	I	have
to	think	about	another.

Group	 murder.	 It’s	 an	 interesting	 theory.	 I	 guess	 I	 should	 be
grateful	the	cops	didn’t	try	to	pin	the	whole	thing	on	me.	Ask	the	other
three	to	nod	and	get	out	of	jail	free.	I’m	sure	Cooper	and	the	blond	girl
would	have	been	more	than	happy	to	play	along.

Maybe	Bronwyn	wouldn’t,	though.
I	close	my	eyes	and	brace	my	hands	on	the	top	of	Stan’s	terrarium,
thinking	about	Bronwyn’s	house.	How	clean	and	bright	it	was,	and	how
she	and	her	sister	talked	to	each	other	like	all	the	interesting	parts	of
their	conversation	were	the	things	they	didn’t	say.	It	must	be	nice,	after


getting	accused	of	murder,	to	come	home	to	a	place	like	that.

When	I	leave	the	house	and	get	on	my	bike,	I	tell	myself	I	don’t
know	where	I’m	going,	and	drive	aimlessly	for	almost	an	hour.	By	the
time	 I	 end	 up	 in	 Bronwyn’s	 driveway,	 it’s	 dinnertime	 for	 normal
people,	and	I	don’t	expect	anyone	to	come	outside.

I’m	wrong,	though.	Someone	does.	It’s	a	tall	man	in	a	fleece	vest
and	a	checked	shirt,	with	short	dark	hair	and	glasses.	He	looks	like	a
guy	who’s	used	to	giving	orders,	and	he	approaches	me	with	a	calm,
measured	tread.

“Nate,	right?”	His	hands	are	on	his	hips,	a	big	watch	glinting	on
one	wrist.	“I’m	Javier	Rojas,	Bronwyn’s	father.	I’m	afraid	you	can’t	be
here.”

He	doesn’t	sound	mad,	just	matter-of-fact.	But	he	also	sounds	like
he’s	never	meant	anything	more	in	his	life.

I	take	my	helmet	off	so	I	can	meet	his	eyes.	“Is	Bronwyn	home?”
It’s	the	most	pointless	question	ever.	Obviously	she	is,	and	obviously
he’s	not	going	to	let	me	see	her.	I	don’t	even	know	why	I	want	to,
except	that	I	can’t.	And	because	I	want	to	ask	her:	 _What’s	true?	What
did	you	do?	What	didn’t	you	do?_

“You	can’t	be	here,”	Javier	Rojas	says	again.	“I’m	sure	you	don’t
want	police	involvement	any	more	than	I	do.”	He’s	doing	a	decent	job
of	 pretending	 I	 wouldn’t	 be	 his	 worst	 nightmare	 even	 if	 I	 weren’t
involved	in	a	murder	investigation	with	his	daughter.

That’s	it,	I	guess.	Lines	are	drawn.	I’m	the	obvious	outlier	and
scapegoat.	There	isn’t	much	else	to	say,	so	I	reverse	out	of	his	driveway
and	head	home.


**Addy**

**Sunday,	September	30,	5:30	p.m.**

Ashton	unlocks	the	door	to	her	condo	in	downtown	San	Diego.	It’s	a
one-bedroom,	because	she	and	Charlie	can’t	afford	anything	bigger.
Especially	with	a	year’s	worth	of	law	school	debt	that’ll	be	hard	to
repay	now	that	Ashton’s	graphic	design	business	hasn’t	taken	off	and
Charlie’s	 decided	 to	 make	 nature	 documentaries	 instead	 of	 being	 a
lawyer.

But	that’s	not	what	we’re	here	to	talk	about.
Ashton	brews	coffee	in	her	kitchen,	which	is	tiny	but	cute:	white
cabinets,	glossy	black	granite	countertops,	stainless	steel	appliances,
and	retro	light	fixtures.	“Where’s	Charlie?”	I	ask	as	she	doctors	mine
with	cream	and	sugar,	pale	and	sweet	the	way	I	like	it.

“Rock	climbing,”	Ashton	says,	pressing	her	lips	into	a	thin	line	as
she	hands	me	the	mug.	Charlie	has	lots	of	hobbies	Ashton	doesn’t
share,	 and	 they’re	 all	 expensive.	 “I’ll	 call	 him	 about	 finding	 you	 a
lawyer.	Maybe	one	of	his	old	professors	knows	someone.”

Ashton	insisted	on	taking	me	to	get	something	to	eat	after	we	left
the	police	station,	and	I	told	her	everything	at	the	restaurant—well,
almost	everything.	The	truth	about	Simon’s	rumor,	anyway.	She	tried
calling	Mom	on	the	way	here,	but	got	voice	mail	and	left	a	cryptic	 _call-
me-as-soon-as-you-get-this_ 	message.

Which	Mom	has	ignored.	Or	not	seen.	Maybe	I	should	give	her	the
benefit	of	the	doubt.

We	take	our	coffee	to	Ashton’s	balcony	and	settle	ourselves	into
bright-red	chairs	on	either	side	of	a	tiny	table.	I	close	my	eyes	and
swallow	 a	 mouthful	 of	 hot,	 sweet	 liquid,	 willing	 myself	 to	 relax.	 It
doesn’t	work,	but	I	keep	sipping	slowly	until	I’m	done.	Ashton	pulls	out
her	phone	and	leaves	a	terse	message	for	Charlie,	then	tries	our	mother


again.	“Still	voice	mail,”	she	sighs,	draining	the	last	of	her	coffee.

“Nobody’s	home	except	us,”	I	say,	and	for	some	reason	that	makes
me	laugh.	A	little	hysterically.	I	might	be	losing	it.

Ashton	rests	her	elbows	on	the	table	and	clasps	her	hands	together
under	her	chin.	“Addy,	you’ve	got	to	tell	Jake	what	happened.”

“Simon’s	update	isn’t	live,”	I	say	weakly,	but	Ashton	shakes	her
head.

“It’ll	get	out.	Maybe	gossip,	maybe	the	police	talking	to	him	to	put
pressure	 on	 you.	 But	 it’s	 something	 you	 need	 to	 deal	 with	 in	 your
relationship	no	matter	what.”	She	hesitates,	tucking	her	hair	behind
her	ears.	“Addy,	is	there	some	part	of	you	that’s	been	 _wanting_ 	Jake	to
find	out?”

Resentment	surges	through	me.	Ashton	can’t	stop	her	anti-Jake
crusade	even	in	the	middle	of	a	crisis.	“Why	would	I	ever	want	that?”

“He	calls	the	shots	on	everything,	doesn’t	he?	Maybe	you	got	tired
of	that.	I	would.”

“ _Right,_ 	because	you’re	the	relationship	expert,”	I	snap.	“I	haven’t
seen	you	and	Charlie	together	in	over	a	month.”

Ashton	purses	her	lips.	“This	isn’t	about	me.	You	need	to	tell	Jake,
and	soon.	You	don’t	want	him	to	hear	this	from	someone	else.”

All	the	fight	goes	out	of	me,	because	I	know	she’s	right.	Waiting
will	only	make	things	worse.	And	since	Mom’s	not	calling	us	back,	I
might	as	well	rip	off	the	Band-Aid.	“Will	you	take	me	to	his	house?”

I	have	a	bunch	of	texts	from	Jake	anyway,	asking	how	things	went
at	the	station.	I	should	probably	be	focusing	on	the	whole	criminal
aspect	of	this,	but	as	usual,	my	mind’s	consumed	with	Jake.	I	take	out
my	phone,	open	my	messages,	and	text,	 _Can	I	tell	you	in	person?_

Jake	 responds	 right	 away.	 “Only	 Girl”	 blares,	 which	 seems
inappropriate	for	the	conversation	that’s	about	to	follow.

_Of	course._
I	rinse	out	our	mugs	while	Ashton	collects	her	keys	and	purse.	We
step	into	the	hallway	and	Ashton	shuts	the	door	behind	us,	tugging	the
knob	to	make	sure	it’s	locked.	I	follow	her	to	the	elevator,	my	nerves
buzzing.	I	shouldn’t	have	had	that	coffee.	Even	if	it	 _was_ 	mostly	milk.


We’re	more	than	halfway	to	Bayview	when	Charlie	calls.	I	try	to
tune	out	Ashton’s	tense,	clipped	conversation,	but	it’s	impossible	in
such	close	quarters.	“I’m	not	asking	for	 _me,_ ”	she	says	at	one	point.
“Can	you	be	the	bigger	person	for	once?”

I	scrunch	in	my	seat	and	take	out	my	phone,	scrolling	through
messages.	Keely’s	sent	half	a	dozen	texts	about	Halloween	costumes,
and	Olivia’s	agonizing	about	whether	she	should	get	back	together	with
Luis.	Again.	Ashton	finally	hangs	up	and	says	with	forced	brightness,
“Charlie’s	going	to	make	a	few	calls	about	a	lawyer.”

“Great.	Tell	him	thanks.”	I	feel	like	I	should	say	more,	but	I’m	not
sure	what,	and	we	lapse	into	silence.	Still,	I’d	rather	spend	hours	in	my
sister’s	quiet	car	than	five	minutes	in	Jake’s	house,	which	looms	in
front	of	us	all	too	quickly.	“I’m	not	sure	how	long	this	will	take,”	I	tell
Ashton	as	she	pulls	into	the	driveway.	“And	I	might	need	a	ride	home.”
Nausea	rolls	through	my	stomach.	If	I	hadn’t	done	what	I	did	with	TJ,
Jake	would	insist	on	being	a	part	of	whatever	comes	next.	The	whole
situation	would	still	be	terrifying,	but	I	wouldn’t	have	to	face	it	on	my
own.

“I’ll	be	at	the	Starbucks	on	Clarendon	Street,”	Ashton	says	as	I
climb	out	of	the	car.	“Text	me	when	you’re	done.”

I	 feel	 sorry,	 then,	 for	 snapping	 at	 her	 and	 goading	 her	 about
Charlie.	If	she	hadn’t	picked	me	up	from	the	police	station,	I	don’t
know	 what	 I	 would	 have	 done.	 But	 she	 backs	 out	 of	 the	 driveway
before	I	can	say	anything,	and	I	start	my	slow	march	to	Jake’s	front
door.

His	mom	answers	when	I	ring	the	bell,	smiling	so	normally	that	I
almost	 think	 everything’s	 going	 to	 be	 okay.	 I’ve	 always	 liked	 Mrs.
Riordan.	She	used	to	be	a	hotshot	advertising	executive	till	right	before
Jake	started	high	school,	when	she	decided	to	downshift	and	focus	on
her	family.	I	think	my	mother	secretly	wishes	she	were	Mrs.	Riordan,
with	 a	 glamorous	 career	 she	 doesn’t	 have	 to	 do	 anymore	 and	 a
handsome,	successful	husband.

Mr.	 Riordan	 can	 be	 intimidating,	 though.	 He’s	 a	 my-way-or-
nothing	 sort	 of	 man.	 Whenever	 I	 mention	 that,	 Ashton	 starts
muttering	about	apples	not	falling	far	from	trees.

“Hi,	 Addy.	 I’m	 on	 my	 way	 out,	 but	 Jake’s	 waiting	 for	 you
downstairs.”


“Thanks,”	I	say,	stepping	past	her	into	the	foyer.
I	can	hear	her	lock	the	door	behind	her	and	her	car	door	slam	as	I
take	the	stairs	down	to	Jake.	The	Riordans	have	a	finished	basement
that’s	basically	Jake’s	domain.	It’s	huge,	and	they	have	a	pool	table	and
a	giant	TV	and	lots	of	overstuffed	chairs	and	couches	down	there,	so
our	friends	hang	out	here	more	than	anywhere	else.	As	usual,	Jake	is
sprawled	on	the	biggest	couch	with	an	Xbox	controller	in	hand.

“Hey,	baby.”	He	pauses	the	game	and	sits	up	when	he	sees	me.
“How’d	everything	go?”

“Not	good,”	I	say,	and	start	shaking	all	over.	Jake’s	face	is	full	of
concern	I	don’t	deserve.	He	gets	to	his	feet,	trying	to	pull	me	down	next
to	him,	but	I	resist	for	once.	I	take	a	seat	in	the	armchair	beside	the
couch.	“I	think	I	should	sit	over	here	while	I	tell	you	this.”

A	frown	creases	Jake’s	forehead.	He	sits	back	down,	on	the	edge	of
the	couch	this	time,	his	elbows	resting	on	his	knees	as	he	gazes	at	me
intently.	“You’re	scaring	me,	Ads.”

“It’s	been	a	scary	day,”	I	say,	twisting	a	strand	of	hair	around	my
finger.	My	throat	feels	as	dry	as	dust.	“The	detective	wanted	to	talk	to
me	because	she	thinks	I...She	thinks	all	of	us	who	were	in	detention
with	 Simon	 that	 day...killed	 him.	 They	 think	 we	 deliberately	 put
peanut	oil	in	his	water	so	he’d	die.”	It	occurs	to	me	as	the	words	slip
out	that	maybe	I	wasn’t	supposed	to	talk	about	this	part.	But	I’m	used
to	telling	Jake	everything.

Jake	stares	at	me,	blinks,	and	barks	out	a	short	laugh.	“Jesus.
That’s	not	funny,	Addy.”	He	almost	never	calls	me	by	my	actual	name.

“I’m	not	joking.	She	thinks	we	did	it	because	he	was	about	to
publish	an	update	of	About	That	featuring	the	four	of	us.	Reporting
awful	things	we’d	never	want	to	get	out.”	I’m	tempted	to	tell	him	the
other	gossip	first— _See,	I’m	not	the	only	horrible	person!_ —but	I	don’t.
“There	was	something	about	me	on	there,	something	true,	that	I	have
to	tell	you.	I	should	have	told	you	when	it	happened	but	I	was	too
scared.”	I	stare	at	the	floor,	my	eyes	focusing	on	a	loose	thread	in	the
plush	blue	carpet.	If	I	pulled	it	I	bet	the	whole	section	would	unravel.

“Go	on,”	Jake	says.	I	can’t	read	his	tone	at	all.
God.	How	can	my	heart	be	hammering	this	hard	and	I	still	be
alive?	It	should	have	burst	out	of	my	chest	by	now.	“At	the	end	of


school	last	year,	when	you	were	in	Cozumel	with	your	parents,	I	ran
into	TJ	at	the	beach.	We	got	a	bottle	of	rum	and	ended	up	getting	really
drunk.	And	I	went	to	TJ’s	house	and,	um,	I	hooked	up	with	him.”	Tears
slide	down	my	cheeks	and	drip	onto	my	collarbone.

“Hooked	up	how?”	Jake	asks	flatly.	I	hesitate,	wondering	if	there’s
any	possible	way	I	can	make	this	sound	less	awful	than	it	is.	But	then
Jake	repeats	himself—“Hooked	up	 _how?_ ”—so	forcefully	that	the	words
spring	out	of	me.

“We	 slept	 together.”	 I’m	 crying	 so	 hard	 I	 can	 barely	 get	 more
words	out.	“I’m	sorry,	Jake.	I	made	a	stupid,	horrible	mistake	and	I’m
so,	so	sorry.”

Jake	doesn’t	say	anything	for	a	minute,	and	when	he	speaks	his
voice	is	icy	cold.	“You’re	sorry,	huh?	That’s	great.	That’s	all	right,	then.
As	long	as	you’re	 _sorry._ ”

“I	really	am,”	I	start,	but	before	I	can	continue	he	springs	up	and
rams	his	fist	into	the	wall	behind	him.	I	can’t	help	the	startled	cry	that
escapes	me.	The	plaster	cracks,	raining	white	dust	across	the	blue	rug.
Jake	shakes	his	fist	and	hits	the	wall	harder.

“ _Fuck,_ 	Addy.	You	screw	my	friend	months	ago,	you’ve	been	lying
to	me	ever	since,	and	you’re	 _sorry_ ?	What	the	hell	is	wrong	with	you?	I
treat	you	like	a	 _queen._ ”

“I	know,”	I	sob,	staring	at	the	bloody	smears	his	knuckles	left	on
the	wall.

“You	let	me	hang	out	with	a	guy	who’s	laughing	his	ass	off	behind
my	back	while	you	jump	out	of	his	bed	and	into	mine	like	nothing
happened.	Pretending	you	give	a	shit	about	me.”	Jake	almost	never
swears	in	my	presence,	or	if	he	does,	he	apologizes	afterward.

“I	do!	Jake,	I	love	you.	I’ve	always	loved	you,	since	the	first	time	I
saw	you.”

“So	why’d	you	do	it?	 _Why?_ ”
I’ve	asked	myself	that	question	for	months	and	can’t	come	up	with
anything	 except	 weak	 excuses.	 _I	 was	 drunk,	 I	 was	 stupid,	 I	 was
insecure._ 	I	guess	that	last	one’s	closest	to	the	truth;	years	of	being	not
enough	finally	catching	up	with	me.	“I	made	a	mistake.	I’d	do	anything
to	fix	it.	If	I	could	take	it	back	I	would.”


“But	 you	 can’t,	 can	 you?”	 Jake	 asks.	 He’s	 silent	 for	 a	 minute,
breathing	hard.	I	don’t	dare	say	another	word.	“Look	at	me.”	I	keep	my
head	in	my	hands	as	long	as	I	can.	“ _Look_ 	at	me,	Addy.	You	fucking	owe
me	that.”

So	I	do,	but	I	wish	I	hadn’t.	His	face—that	beautiful	face	I’ve	loved
since	before	it	ever	looked	as	good	as	it	does	now—is	twisted	with	rage.
“You	ruined	everything.	You	know	that,	right?”

“I	know.”	It	comes	out	as	a	moan,	like	I’m	a	trapped	animal.	If	I
could	gnaw	my	own	limb	off	to	escape	this	situation,	I	would.

“Get	out.	Get	the	hell	out	of	my	house.	I	can’t	stand	the	sight	of
you.”

I’m	not	sure	how	I	manage	to	get	up	the	stairs,	never	mind	out	the
door.	Once	I’m	in	the	driveway	I	scramble	through	my	bag	trying	to
find	my	phone.	There’s	no	way	I	can	stand	in	Jake’s	driveway	sobbing
while	I	wait	for	Ashton.	I	need	to	walk	to	Clarendon	Street	and	find
her.	Then	a	car	across	the	street	beeps	softly,	and	through	a	haze	of
tears	I	watch	my	sister	lower	her	window.

Her	mouth	droops	as	I	approach.	“I	thought	it	might	go	like	this.
Come	on,	get	in.	Mom’s	waiting	for	us.”



**Bronwyn**

**Monday,	October	1,	7:30	a.m.**

I	get	ready	for	school	on	Monday	the	way	I	always	do.	Up	at	six	so	I	can
run	for	half	an	hour.	Oatmeal	with	berries	and	orange	juice	at	six-
thirty,	a	shower	ten	minutes	later.	Dry	my	hair,	pick	out	clothes,	put	on
sunscreen.	Scan	the	 _New	York	Times_ 	for	ten	minutes.	Check	my	email,
pack	my	books,	make	sure	my	phone’s	fully	charged.

The	only	thing	that’s	different	is	the	seven-thirty	meeting	with	my
lawyer.

Her	name	is	Robin	Stafford,	and	according	to	my	father	she’s	a
brilliant,	highly	successful	criminal	defense	attorney.	But	not	 _overly_
high-profile.	 Not	 the	 kind	 of	 lawyer	 automatically	 associated	 with
guilty	rich	people	trying	to	buy	their	way	out	of	trouble.	She’s	right	on
time	and	gives	me	a	wide,	warm	smile	when	Maeve	leads	her	into	the
kitchen.

I	wouldn’t	be	able	to	guess	her	age	by	looking	at	her,	but	the	bio
my	father	showed	me	last	night	says	she’s	forty-one.	She’s	wearing	a
cream-colored	suit	that’s	striking	against	her	dark	skin,	subtle	gold
jewelry,	and	shoes	that	look	expensive	but	not	Jimmy	Choo	level.

She	takes	a	seat	at	our	kitchen	island	across	from	my	parents	and
me.	“Bronwyn,	it’s	a	pleasure.	Let’s	talk	about	what	you	might	expect
today	and	how	you	should	handle	school.”

Sure.	 Because	 that’s	 my	 life	 now.	 School	 is	 something	 to	 be
_handled._

She	folds	her	hands	in	front	of	her.	“I’m	not	sure	the	police	truly
believed	the	four	of	you	planned	this	together,	but	I	do	think	they
hoped	 to	 shock	 and	 pressure	 one	 of	 you	 into	 giving	 up	 useful
information.	That	indicates	their	evidence	is	flimsy	at	best.	If	none	of
you	point	fingers	and	your	stories	line	up,	they	don’t	have	anywhere	to


take	this	investigation,	and	it’s	my	belief	it	will	ultimately	be	closed	out
as	an	accidental	death.”

The	vise	that’s	been	gripping	my	chest	all	morning	loosens	a	little.
“Even	though	Simon	was	about	to	post	those	awful	things	about	us?
And	there’s	that	whole	Tumblr	thing	going	on?”

Robin	gives	an	elegant	little	shrug.	“At	the	end	of	the	day,	that’s
nothing	but	gossip	and	trolling.	I	know	you	kids	take	it	seriously,	but	in
the	legal	world	it’s	meaningless	unless	hard	proof	emerges	to	back	it
up.	The	best	thing	you	can	do	is	not	talk	about	the	case.	Certainly	not
with	the	police,	but	not	with	school	administrators	either.”

“What	if	they	ask?”
“Tell	 them	 you’ve	 retained	 counsel	 and	 can’t	 answer	 questions
without	your	lawyer	present.”

I	try	to	imagine	having	that	conversation	with	Principal	Gupta.	I
don’t	know	what	the	school’s	heard	about	this,	but	me	pleading	the
Fifth	would	be	a	major	red	flag.

“Are	you	friendly	with	the	other	kids	who	were	in	detention	that
day?”	Robin	asks.

“Not	exactly.	Cooper	and	I	have	some	classes	together,	but—”
“Bronwyn.”	My	mother	interrupts	with	a	chill	in	her	voice.	“You’re
friendly	enough	with	Nate	Macauley	that	he	showed	up	here	last	night.
For	the	 _third_ 	time.”

Robin	sits	straighter	in	her	chair,	and	I	flush.	That	was	a	big	topic
of	discussion	last	night	after	my	dad	made	Nate	leave.	Dad	thought
he’d	stalked	our	address	in	a	creepy	way,	so	I	had	some	explaining	to
do.

“Why	has	Nate	been	here	three	times,	Bronwyn?”	Robin	asks	with
a	polite,	interested	air.

“It’s	no	big	deal.	He	gave	me	a	ride	home	after	Simon	died.	Then
he	stopped	by	last	Friday	to	hang	out	for	a	while.	And	I	don’t	know
what	he	was	doing	here	last	night,	since	nobody	would	let	me	talk	to
him.”

“It’s	the	‘hanging	out’	while	your	parents	aren’t	home	that	disturbs
me—”	my	mother	starts,	but	Robin	interrupts	her.

```
“Bronwyn,	what’s	the	nature	of	your	relationship	with	Nate?”
```

_I	have	no	idea.	Maybe	you	could	help	me	analyze	it?	Is	that	part
of	your	retainer?_ 	“I	hardly	know	him.	I	hadn’t	talked	to	him	in	years
before	last	week.	We’re	both	in	this	weird	situation	and...it	helps	to	be
around	other	people	going	through	the	same	thing.”

“I	recommend	maintaining	distance	from	the	others,”	Robin	says,
ignoring	my	mother’s	evil	eye	in	my	direction.	“No	need	to	give	the
police	further	ammunition	for	their	theories.	If	your	cell	phone	and
email	are	examined,	will	they	show	recent	communication	with	those
three	students?”

“No,”	I	say	truthfully.
“That’s	good	news.”	She	glances	at	her	watch,	a	slim	gold	Rolex.
“That’s	all	we	can	address	now	if	you’re	going	to	get	to	school	on	time,
which	you	should.	Business	as	usual.”	She	flashes	me	that	warm	smile
again.	“We’ll	talk	more	in	depth	later.”

I	say	good-bye	to	my	parents,	not	quite	able	to	look	them	in	the
eye,	and	call	for	Maeve	as	I	grab	the	keys	to	the	Volvo.	I	spend	the
whole	drive	steeling	myself	for	something	awful	to	happen	once	we	get
to	 school,	 but	 it’s	 weirdly	 normal.	 No	 police	 lying	 in	 wait	 for	 me.
Nobody’s	looking	at	me	any	differently	than	they	have	since	the	first
Tumblr	post	came	out.

Still,	I’m	only	half	paying	attention	to	Kate	and	Yumiko’s	chatter
after	 homeroom,	 my	 eyes	 roaming	 the	 hallway.	 There’s	 only	 one
person	I	want	to	talk	to,	even	though	it’s	exactly	who	I’m	supposed	to
stay	away	from.	“Catch	you	guys	later,	okay?”	I	murmur,	and	intercept
Nate	after	he	ducks	into	the	back	stairwell.

If	he’s	surprised	to	see	me,	he	doesn’t	show	it.	“Bronwyn.	How’s
the	family?”

I	lean	against	the	wall	next	to	him	and	lower	my	voice.	“I	wanted
to	 apologize	 for	 my	 dad	 making	 you	 leave	 last	 night.	 He’s	 kind	 of
freaked	out	by	all	this.”

“Wonder	why.”	Nate	drops	his	voice	as	well.	“You	been	searched
yet?”	My	eyes	widen,	and	he	laughs	darkly.	“Didn’t	think	so.	I	was.
You’re	probably	not	supposed	to	be	talking	to	me,	right?”

I	can’t	help	but	glance	around	the	empty	stairwell.	I’m	already
paranoid	and	Nate’s	not	helping.	I	have	to	keep	reminding	myself	that
we	did	not,	in	fact,	conspire	to	commit	murder.	“Why	did	you	stop	by?”


His	 eyes	 search	 mine	 as	 though	 he’s	 about	 to	 say	 something
profound	about	life	and	death	and	the	presumption	of	innocence.	“I
was	going	to	apologize	for	stealing	Jesus	from	you.”

I	 recoil	 a	 little.	 I	 have	 no	 idea	 what	 he’s	 talking	 about.	 Is	 he
making	some	kind	of	religious	allegory?	“What?”

“In	the	fourth-grade	Nativity	play	at	St.	Pius.	I	stole	Jesus	and	you
had	to	carry	a	bag	wrapped	in	a	blanket.	Sorry	about	that.”

I	stare	at	him	for	a	second	as	the	tension	flows	out	of	me,	leaving
me	limp	and	slightly	giddy.	I	punch	him	in	the	shoulder,	startling	him
so	much	he	actually	laughs.	“I	 _knew_ 	it	was	you.	Why’d	you	do	that?”

“To	get	a	rise	out	of	you.”	He	grins	at	me,	and	for	a	second	I	forget
everything	except	the	fact	that	Nate	Macauley	still	has	an	adorable
smile.	“Also,	I	wanted	to	talk	to	you	about—all	this.	But	I	guess	it’s	too
late.	You	must	be	lawyered	up	by	now,	right?”	His	smile	disappears.

“Yes,	but...I	want	to	talk	to	you	too.”	The	bell	rings,	and	I	pull	out
my	 phone.	 Then	 I	 remember	 Robin	 asking	 about	 communication
records	between	the	four	of	us	and	stuff	it	back	into	my	bag.	Nate
catches	the	gesture	and	snorts	another	humorless	laugh.

“Yeah,	exchanging	numbers	is	a	shit	idea.	Unless	you	want	to	use
this.”	He	reaches	into	his	backpack	and	hands	me	a	flip	phone.

I	take	it	gingerly.	“What	is	it?”
“An	extra	phone.	I	have	a	few.”	I	run	my	thumb	across	the	cover
with	a	dawning	idea	of	what	it	might	be	for,	and	he	adds	hastily,	“It’s
new.	Nobody’s	going	to	call	it	or	anything.	But	I	have	the	number.	I’ll
call	you.	You	can	answer,	or	not.	Up	to	you.”	He	pauses,	and	adds,
“Just	don’t,	you	know,	leave	it	lying	around.	They	get	a	warrant	for
your	 phone	 and	 computer,	 that’s	 all	 they	 can	 touch.	 They	 can’t	 go
through	your	whole	house.”

I’m	pretty	sure	my	expensive	lawyer	would	tell	me	not	to	take	legal
advice	from	Nate	Macauley.	And	she’d	probably	have	something	to	say
about	the	fact	that	he	has	an	apparently	inexhaustible	supply	of	the
same	cheap	phones	that	corralled	us	all	in	detention	last	week.	I	watch
him	head	up	the	stairs,	knowing	I	should	drop	the	phone	into	the
nearest	trash	can.	But	I	put	it	in	my	backpack	instead.

**Cooper**

**Monday,	October	1,	11:00	a.m.**


It’s	almost	a	relief	to	be	at	school.	Better	than	home,	where	Pop	spent
hours	ranting	about	how	Simon’s	a	liar	and	the	police	are	incompetent
and	the	school	should	be	on	the	hook	for	this	and	lawyers	will	cost	a
fortune	we	don’t	have.

He	didn’t	ask	if	any	of	it	was	true.
We’re	in	a	weird	limbo	now.	Everything’s	different	but	it	all	looks
the	same.	Except	Jake	and	Addy,	who’re	walking	around	like	they	want
to	kill	and	die,	respectively.	Bronwyn	gives	me	the	least	convincing
smile	 ever	 in	 the	 hallway,	 her	 lips	 pressed	 so	 tight	 they	 almost
disappear.	Nate’s	nowhere	in	sight.

We’re	all	waiting	for	something	to	happen,	I	guess.
After	gym	something	does,	but	it	doesn’t	have	anything	to	do	with
me.	My	friends	and	I	are	heading	for	the	locker	room	after	playing
soccer,	lagging	behind	everyone	else,	and	Luis	is	going	on	about	some
new	junior	girl	he’s	got	his	eye	on.	Our	gym	teacher	opens	the	door	to
let	a	bunch	of	kids	inside	when	Jake	suddenly	whirls	around,	grabs	TJ
by	the	shoulder,	and	punches	him	in	the	face.

Of	course.	“TF”	from	About	That	is	TJ	Forrester.	The	lack	of	a	 _J_
confused	me.

I	grab	Jake’s	arms,	pulling	him	back	before	he	can	throw	another
punch,	but	he’s	so	furious	he	almost	gets	away	from	me	before	Luis
steps	 in	 to	 help.	 Even	 then,	 two	 of	 us	 can	 barely	 hold	 him.	 “You
_asshole,_ ”	Jake	spits	at	TJ,	who	staggers	but	doesn’t	fall.	TJ	puts	a	hand
to	his	bloody,	probably	broken	mess	of	a	nose.	He	doesn’t	make	any
effort	to	go	after	Jake.

“Jake,	come	on,	man,”	I	say	as	the	gym	teacher	races	toward	us.
“You’re	gonna	get	suspended.”

“Worth	it,”	Jake	says	bitterly.
So	instead	of	today’s	big	story	being	Simon,	it’s	about	how	Jake
Riordan	got	sent	home	for	punching	TJ	Forrester	after	gym	class.	And
since	Jake	refused	to	speak	to	Addy	before	he	left	and	she’s	practically
in	tears,	everyone’s	pretty	sure	they	know	why.

“How	 could	 she?”	 Keely	 murmurs	 in	 the	 lunch	 line	 as	 Addy
shuffles	around	like	a	sleepwalker.

```
“We	don’t	know	the	whole	story,”	I	remind	her.
```

I	guess	it’s	good	Jake’s	not	here	since	Addy	sits	with	us	at	lunch
like	usual.	I’m	not	sure	she’d	have	the	nerve	otherwise.	But	she	doesn’t
talk	to	anybody,	and	nobody	talks	to	her.	They’re	pretty	obvious	about
it.	 Vanessa,	 who’s	 always	 been	 the	 bitchiest	 girl	 in	 our	 group,
physically	turns	away	when	Addy	takes	the	chair	next	to	her.	Even
Keely	doesn’t	make	any	effort	to	include	Addy	in	the	conversation.

Bunch	of	hypocrites.	Luis	was	on	Simon’s	app	for	the	same	damn
thing	and	Vanessa	tried	to	give	me	a	hand	job	at	a	pool	party	last
month,	so	they	shouldn’t	be	judging	anyone.

“How’s	it	goin’,	Addy?”	I	ask,	ignoring	the	stares	of	the	rest	of	the
table.

“Don’t	be	nice,	Cooper.”	She	keeps	her	head	down,	her	voice	so
low	I	can	hardly	hear	it.	“It’s	worse	if	you’re	nice.”

“Addy.”	All	the	frustration	and	fear	I’ve	been	feeling	finds	its	way
into	my	voice,	and	when	Addy	looks	up	a	jolt	of	understanding	passes
between	us.	There’re	a	million	things	we	should	be	talking	about,	but
we	can’t	say	any	of	them.	“It’ll	be	all	right.”

Keely	puts	her	hand	on	my	arm,	asking,	“What	do	 _you_ 	think?”	and
I	realize	I’ve	missed	an	entire	conversation.

“About	what?”
She	gives	me	a	little	shake.	“About	Halloween!	What	should	we	be
for	Vanessa’s	party?”

I’m	disoriented,	like	I	just	got	yanked	into	some	shiny	video-game
version	 of	 the	 world	 where	 everything’s	 too	 bright	 and	 I	 don’t
understand	 the	 rules.	 “God,	 Keely,	 I	 don’t	 know.	 Whatever.	 That’s
almost	a	month	away.”

Olivia	clucks	her	tongue	disapprovingly.	“Typical	guy.	You	have	no
idea	how	hard	it	is	to	find	a	costume	that’s	sexy	but	not	slutty.”

Luis	waggles	his	brows	at	her.	“Just	be	slutty,	then,”	he	suggests,
and	Olivia	smacks	his	arm.	The	cafeteria’s	too	warm,	almost	hot,	and	I
wipe	my	damp	brow	as	Addy	and	I	exchange	another	look.

Keely	pokes	me.	“Give	me	your	phone.”
“What?”
“I	 want	 to	 look	 at	 that	 picture	 we	 took	 last	 week,	 at	 Seaport
Village?	That	woman	in	the	flapper	dress.	She	looked	amazing.	Maybe


I	 could	 do	 something	 like	 that.”	 I	 shrug	 and	 pull	 out	 my	 phone,
unlocking	it	and	handing	it	over.	She	squeezes	my	arm	as	she	opens
my	photos.	“You’d	look	totally	hot	in	one	of	those	gangster	suits.”

She	 hands	 the	 phone	 to	 Vanessa,	 who	 gives	 an	 exaggerated,
breathless	“Ohhh!”	Addy	pushes	food	around	on	her	plate	without	ever
lifting	her	fork	to	her	mouth,	and	I’m	about	to	ask	her	if	she	wants	me
to	get	her	something	else	when	my	phone	rings.

Vanessa	keeps	hold	of	it	and	snorts,	“Who	calls	during	 _lunch_?
Everybody	you	know	is	already	here!”	She	looks	at	the	screen,	then	at
me.	“Ooh,	Cooper.	Who’s	 _Kris_ ?	Should	Keely	be	jealous?”

I	don’t	answer	for	a	few	seconds	too	long,	then	too	fast.	“Just,	um,
a	guy	I	know.	From	baseball.”	My	whole	face	feels	hot	and	prickly	as	I
take	the	phone	from	Vanessa	and	send	it	to	voice	mail.	I	wish	like	hell	I
could	take	that	call,	but	now’s	not	the	time.

Vanessa	raises	an	eyebrow.	“A	boy	who	spells	 _Chris_ 	with	a	 _K_ ?”
“Yeah.	He’s...German.”	 _God.	Stop	talking._ 	I	put	my	phone	in	my
pocket	and	turn	to	Keely,	whose	lips	are	slightly	parted	like	she’s	about
to	ask	a	question.	“I’ll	call	him	back	later.	So.	A	flapper,	huh?”

```
—
```
I’m	about	to	head	home	after	the	last	bell	when	Coach	Ruffalo	stops
me	in	the	hall.	“You	didn’t	forget	about	our	meeting,	did	you?”

I	 exhale	 in	 frustration	 because	 yeah,	 I	 did.	 Pop’s	 leaving	 work
early	so	we	can	meet	with	a	lawyer,	but	Coach	Ruffalo	wants	to	talk
college	recruiting.	I’m	torn,	because	I’m	pretty	sure	Pop	would	want
me	to	do	both	at	the	same	time.	Since	that’s	not	possible,	I	follow
Coach	Ruffalo	and	figure	I’ll	make	it	quick.	His	office	is	next	to	the	gym
and	 smells	 like	 twenty	 years’	 worth	 of	 student	 athletes	 passing
through.	In	other	words,	not	good.

“My	phone’s	ringing	off	the	hook	for	you,	Cooper,”	he	says	as	I	sit
across	from	him	in	a	lopsided	metal	chair	that	creaks	under	my	weight.
“UCLA,	 Louisville,	 and	 Illinois	 are	 putting	 together	 full-scholarship
offers.	They’re	all	pushing	for	a	November	commitment	even	though	I
told	them	there’s	no	way	you’ll	make	a	decision	before	spring.”	He
catches	my	expression	and	adds,	“It’s	good	to	keep	your	options	open.
Obviously	the	draft’s	a	real	possibility	but	the	more	interest	there	is	on
the	college	level,	the	better	you’ll	look	to	the	majors.”


“Yes,	sir.”	It’s	not	draft	strategy	I’m	worried	about.	It’s	how	these
colleges	will	react	if	the	stuff	on	Simon’s	app	gets	out.	Or	if	this	whole
thing	spirals	and	I	keep	getting	investigated	by	the	police.	Are	all	these
offers	gonna	dry	up,	or	am	I	innocent	until	proven	guilty?	I’m	not	sure
if	I	should	be	telling	any	of	this	to	Coach	Ruffalo.	“It’s	just...hard	to
keep	’em	all	straight.”

He	picks	up	a	thin	sheaf	of	stapled-together	papers,	waving	them
at	me.	“I’ve	done	it	for	you.	Here’s	a	list	of	every	college	I’ve	been	in
touch	with	and	their	current	offer.	I’ve	highlighted	the	ones	I	think	are
the	 best	 fit	 or	 will	 be	 most	 impressive	 to	 the	 majors.	 I	 wouldn’t
necessarily	put	Cal	State	or	UC	Santa	Barbara	on	the	short	list,	but
they’re	 both	 local	 and	 offering	 facility	 tours.	 You	 want	 to	 schedule
those	some	weekend,	let	me	know.”

“Okay.	I...I	have	some	family	stuff	coming	up,	so	I	might	be	kinda
busy	for	a	while.”

“Sure,	sure.	No	rush,	no	pressure.	It’s	entirely	up	to	you,	Cooper.”
People	always	say	that	but	it	doesn’t	feel	true.	About	anything.
I	thank	Coach	Ruffalo	and	head	into	the	almost-empty	hallway.	I
have	my	phone	in	one	hand	and	Coach’s	list	in	the	other,	and	I’m	so
lost	in	thought	as	I	look	between	them	that	I	almost	mow	someone
over	in	my	path.

“Sorry,”	 I	 say,	 taking	 in	 a	 slight	 figure	 with	 his	 arms	 wrapped
around	a	box.	“Uh...hey,	Mr.	Avery.	You	need	help	carrying	that?”

“No	thank	you,	Cooper.”	I’m	a	lot	taller	than	he	is,	and	when	I	look
down	 I	 don’t	 see	 anything	 but	 folders	 in	 the	 box.	 I	 guess	 he	 can
manage	those.	Mr.	Avery’s	watery	eyes	narrow	when	he	sees	my	phone.
“I	wouldn’t	want	to	interrupt	your	 _texting._ ”

“I	was	just...”	I	trail	off,	since	explaining	the	lawyer	appointment
I’m	almost	late	for	won’t	win	me	any	points.

Mr.	 Avery	 sniffs	 and	 adjusts	 his	 grip	 on	 the	 box.	 “I	 don’t
understand	you	kids.	So	obsessed	with	your	screens	and	your	 _gossip._ ”
He	grimaces	like	the	word	tastes	bad,	and	I’m	not	sure	what	to	say.	Is
he	 making	 a	 reference	 to	 Simon?	 I	 wonder	 if	 the	 police	 bothered
questioning	Mr.	Avery	this	weekend,	or	if	he’s	been	disqualified	by
virtue	of	not	having	a	motive.	That	they	know	of,	anyway.

```
He	shakes	himself,	like	he	doesn’t	know	what	he’s	talking	about
```

either.	“Anyway.	If	you’ll	excuse	me,	Cooper.”

All	he’d	have	to	do	to	get	past	me	is	step	aside,	but	I	guess	that’s
my	job.	“Right,”	I	say,	moving	out	of	his	way.	I	watch	him	shuffle	down
the	hall	and	decide	to	leave	my	stuff	in	my	locker	and	head	for	the	car.
I’m	late	enough	as	it	is.

I’m	stopped	at	the	last	red	light	before	my	house	when	my	phone
beeps.	I	look	down	expecting	a	text	from	Keely,	because	somehow	I
ended	 up	 promising	 we’d	 get	 together	 tonight	 to	 plan	 Halloween
costumes.	But	it’s	from	my	mom.

```
Meet	us	at	the	hospital.	Nonny	had	a	heart	attack.

**Nate**

**Monday,	October	1,	11:50	p.m.**

I	made	a	round	of	calls	to	my	suppliers	this	morning	to	tell	them	I’m
out	of	commission	for	a	while.	Then	I	threw	away	that	phone.	I	still
have	a	couple	of	others.	I	usually	pay	cash	for	a	bunch	at	Walmart	and
rotate	them	for	a	few	months	before	replacing	them.

So	after	I’ve	watched	as	many	Japanese	horror	movies	as	I	can
stand	and	it’s	almost	midnight,	I	take	a	new	phone	out	and	call	the	one
I	gave	Bronwyn.	It	rings	six	times	before	she	picks	up,	and	she	sounds
nervous	as	hell.	“Hello?”

I’m	tempted	to	disguise	my	voice	and	ask	if	I	can	buy	a	bag	of
heroin	to	mess	with	her,	but	she’d	probably	throw	the	phone	out	and
never	talk	to	me	again.	“Hey.”

“It’s	late,”	she	says	accusingly.
“Were	you	sleeping?”
“No,”	she	admits.	“I	can’t.”
“Me	 either.”	 Neither	 of	 us	 says	 anything	 for	 a	 minute.	 I’m
stretched	 out	 on	 my	 bed	 with	 a	 couple	 of	 thin	 pillows	 behind	 me,
staring	at	paused	screen	credits	in	Japanese.	I	click	off	the	movie	and
scroll	through	the	channel	guide.

“Nate,	do	you	remember	Olivia	Kendrick’s	birthday	party	in	fifth
grade?”

I	do,	actually.	It	was	the	last	birthday	party	I	ever	went	to	at	St.
Pius,	before	my	dad	withdrew	me	because	we	couldn’t	pay	the	tuition
anymore.	Olivia	invited	the	whole	class	and	had	a	scavenger	hunt	in
her	yard	and	the	woods	behind	it.	Bronwyn	and	I	were	on	the	same
team,	and	she	tore	through	those	clues	like	it	was	her	job	and	she	was
up	for	a	promotion.	We	won	and	all	five	of	us	got	twenty-dollar	iTunes
gift	cards.	“Yeah.”


“I	think	that’s	the	last	time	you	and	I	spoke	before	all	this.”
“Maybe.”	I	remember	better	than	she	probably	realizes.	In	fifth
grade	my	friends	started	noticing	girls	and	at	one	point	they	all	had
girlfriends	for,	like,	a	week.	Stupid	kid	stuff	where	they	asked	a	girl	out,
the	girl	said	yes,	and	then	they	ignored	each	other.	While	we	were
walking	through	Olivia’s	woods	I	watched	Bronwyn’s	ponytail	swing	in
front	 of	 me	 and	 wondered	 what	 she’d	 say	 if	 I	 asked	 her	 to	 be	 my
girlfriend.	I	didn’t	do	it,	though.

“Where’d	you	go	after	St.	Pi?”	she	asks.
“Granger.”	St.	Pius	went	up	to	eighth	grade,	so	I	wasn’t	in	school
with	 Bronwyn	 again	 until	 high	 school.	 By	 then	 she	 was	 in	 full-on
overachiever	mode.

She	pauses,	as	though	she’s	waiting	for	me	to	continue,	and	laughs
a	little.	“Nate,	why’d	you	call	me	if	you’re	only	going	to	give	one-word
answers	to	everything?”

“Maybe	you’re	not	asking	the	right	questions.”
“Okay.”	Another	pause.	“Did	you	do	it?”
I	don’t	have	to	ask	what	she	means.	“Yes	and	no.”
“You’ll	have	to	be	more	specific.”
“Yes,	I	sold	drugs	while	on	probation	 _for_ 	selling	drugs.	No,	I	didn’t
dump	peanut	oil	in	Simon	Kelleher’s	cup.	You?”

“Same,”	she	says	quietly.	“Yes	and	no.”
“So	you	cheated?”
“Yes.”	Her	voice	wavers,	and	if	she	starts	crying	I	don’t	know	what
I’ll	do.	Pretend	the	call	dropped,	maybe.	But	she	pulls	herself	together.
“I’m	really	ashamed.	And	I’m	so	afraid	of	people	finding	out.”

She’s	all	worried-sounding,	so	I	probably	shouldn’t	laugh,	but	I
can’t	help	it.	“So	you’re	not	perfect.	So	what?	Welcome	to	the	real
world.”

“I’m	familiar	with	the	real	world.”	Bronwyn’s	voice	is	cool.	“I	don’t
live	in	a	bubble.	I’m	sorry	for	what	I	did,	that’s	all.”

She	probably	is,	but	it’s	not	the	whole	truth.	Reality’s	messier	than
that.	She	had	months	to	confess	if	it	was	really	eating	at	her,	and	she
didn’t.	 I	 don’t	 know	 why	 it’s	 so	 hard	 for	 people	 to	 admit	 that


sometimes	 they’re	 just	 assholes	 who	 screw	 up	 because	 they	 don’t
expect	to	get	caught.	“You	sound	more	worried	about	what	people	are
gonna	think,”	I	say.

“There’s	nothing	wrong	with	worrying	about	what	people	think.	It
keeps	you	off	 _probation._ ”

My	main	phone	beeps.	It’s	next	to	my	bed	on	the	scarred	side	table
that	lurches	every	time	I	touch	it,	because	it’s	missing	a	leg	tip	and	I’m
too	lazy	to	fix	it.	I	roll	over	to	read	a	text	from	Amber:	 _U	up?_ 	I’m	about
to	tell	Bronwyn	I	have	to	go	when	she	heaves	a	sigh.

“Sorry.	Low	blow.	It’s	just...it’s	more	complicated	than	that,	for
me.	I’ve	disappointed	both	my	parents,	but	it’s	worse	for	my	dad.	He’s
always	 pushing	 against	 stereotypes	 because	 he’s	 not	 from	 here.	 He
built	this	great	reputation,	and	I	could	tarnish	the	whole	thing	with	one
stupid	move.”

I’m	about	to	tell	her	nobody	thinks	that	way.	Her	family	looks
pretty	untouchable	from	where	I	sit.	But	I	guess	everyone	has	shit	to
deal	 with,	 and	 I	 don’t	 know	 hers.	 “Where’s	 your	 dad	 from?”	 I	 ask
instead.

“He	was	born	in	Colombia,	but	moved	here	when	he	was	ten.”
“What	about	your	mom?”
“Oh,	her	family’s	been	here	forever.	Fourth-generation	Irish	or
something.”

“Mine	 too,”	 I	 say.	 “But	 let’s	 just	 say	 my	 fall	 from	 grace	 won’t
surprise	anyone.”

She	sighs.	“This	is	all	so	surreal,	isn’t	it?	That	anybody	could	think
either	one	of	us	would	actually	 _kill_ 	Simon.”

“You’re	 taking	 me	 at	 my	 word?”	 I	 ask.	 “I’m	 on	 _probation,_
remember?”

“Yeah,	but	I	was	there	when	you	tried	to	help	Simon.	You’d	have
to	be	a	pretty	good	actor	to	fake	that.”

“If	I’m	enough	of	a	sociopath	to	kill	Simon	I	can	fake	anything,
right?”

```
“You’re	not	a	sociopath.”
“How	do	you	know?”	I	say	it	like	I’m	making	fun,	but	I	really	want
```

to	know	the	answer.	I’m	the	guy	who	got	searched.	 _The	obvious	outlier
and	scapegoat,_ 	as	Officer	Lopez	said.	Someone	who	lies	whenever	it’s
convenient	and	would	do	it	in	a	heartbeat	to	save	his	own	ass.	I’m	not
sure	how	all	that	adds	up	to	trust	for	someone	I	hadn’t	talked	to	in	six
years.

Bronwyn	doesn’t	answer	right	away,	and	I	stop	channel	surfing	at
the	Cartoon	Network	to	watch	a	snippet	of	some	new	show	with	a	kid
and	a	snake.	It	doesn’t	look	promising.	“I	remember	how	you	used	to
look	 out	 for	 your	 mom,”	 she	 finally	 says.	 “When	 she’d	 show	 up	 at
school	and	act...you	know.	Like	she	was	sick	or	something.”

_Like	 she	 was	 sick	 or	 something._ I	 guess	 Bronwyn	 could	 be
referring	 to	 the	 time	 my	 mother	 screamed	 at	 Sister	 Flynn	 during
parent-teacher	conferences	and	ended	up	ripping	all	our	artwork	off
the	walls.	Or	the	way	she’d	cry	on	the	curb	while	she	was	waiting	to
pick	me	up	from	soccer	practice.	There’s	a	lot	to	choose	from.

“I	really	liked	your	mom,”	Bronwyn	says	tentatively	when	I	don’t
answer.	“She	used	to	talk	to	me	like	I	was	a	grown-up.”

“She’d	swear	at	you,	you	mean,”	I	say,	and	Bronwyn	laughs.
“I	always	thought	it	was	more	like	she	was	swearing	 _with_ 	me.”
Something	about	the	way	she	says	that	gets	to	me.	Like	she	could
see	the	person	under	all	the	other	crap.	“She	liked	you.”	I	think	about
Bronwyn	in	the	stairwell	today,	her	hair	still	in	that	shiny	ponytail	and
her	face	bright.	As	if	everything	is	interesting	and	worth	her	time.	 _If
she	were	around,	she’d	like	you	now._

“She	used	to	tell	me...”	Bronwyn	pauses.	“She	said	you	only	teased
me	so	much	because	you	had	a	crush	on	me.”

I	glance	at	Amber’s	text,	still	unanswered.	“I	might	have.	I	don’t
remember.”

```
Like	I	said.	I	lie	whenever	it’s	convenient.
Bronwyn’s	quiet	for	a	minute.	“I	should	go.	At	least	try	to	sleep.”
“Yeah.	Me	too.”
“I	guess	we’ll	see	what	happens	tomorrow,	huh?”
“Guess	so.”
“Well,	bye.	And,	um,	Nate?”	She	speaks	quickly,	in	a	rush.	“I	had	a
```

crush	on	 _you_ 	back	then.	For	whatever	that’s	worth.	Nothing,	probably.
But	anyway.	FYI.	So,	good	night.”

After	she	hangs	up	I	put	the	phone	on	my	bedside	table	and	pick
up	the	other	one.	I	read	Amber’s	message	again,	then	type,	 _Come	over._

```
Bronwyn’s	naïve	if	she	thinks	there’s	more	to	me	than	that.
```
**Addy**

**Wednesday,	October	3,	7:50	a.m.**

Ashton	keeps	making	me	go	to	school.	My	mother	couldn’t	care	less.
As	far	as	she’s	concerned	I’ve	ruined	all	our	lives,	so	it	doesn’t	much
matter	what	I	do	anymore.	She	doesn’t	say	those	exact	words,	but
they’re	etched	across	her	face	every	time	she	looks	at	me.

“Five	 thousand	 dollars	 just	 to	 talk	 to	 a	 lawyer,	 Adelaide,”	 she
hisses	at	me	over	breakfast	Thursday	morning.	“I	hope	you	know	that’s
coming	out	of	your	college	fund.”

I’d	roll	my	eyes	if	I	had	the	energy.	We	both	know	I	don’t	have	a
college	fund.	She’s	been	on	the	phone	to	my	father	in	Chicago	for	days,
hassling	him	for	the	money.	He	doesn’t	have	much	to	spare,	thanks	to
his	second,	younger	family,	but	he’ll	probably	send	at	least	half	to	shut
her	up	and	feel	good	about	what	an	involved	parent	he	is.

Jake	still	won’t	talk	to	me,	and	I	miss	him	so	much,	it’s	like	I’ve
been	hollowed	out	by	a	nuclear	blast	and	there’s	nothing	left	but	ashes
fluttering	inside	brittle	bones.	I’ve	sent	him	dozens	of	texts	that	aren’t
only	unanswered;	they’re	unread.	He	unfriended	me	on	Facebook	and
unfollowed	me	on	Instagram	and	Snapchat.	He’s	pretending	I	don’t
exist	and	I’m	starting	to	think	he’s	right.	If	I’m	not	Jake’s	girlfriend,
who	am	I?

He	was	supposed	to	be	suspended	all	week	for	hitting	TJ,	but	his
parents	raised	a	fuss	about	how	Simon’s	death	has	put	everyone	on
edge,	so	I	guess	he’s	back	today.	The	thought	of	seeing	him	makes	me
sick	enough	that	I	decided	to	stay	home.	Ashton	had	to	drag	me	out	of
bed.	She’s	staying	with	us	indefinitely,	for	now.

“You’re	not	going	to	wither	up	and	die	from	this,	Addy,”	Ashton
lectures	as	she	shoves	me	toward	the	shower.	“He	doesn’t	get	to	erase
you	from	the	world.	God,	you	made	a	stupid	mistake.	It’s	not	like	you
murdered	someone.

```
“Well,”	she	adds	with	a	short,	sarcastic	laugh,	“I	guess	the	jury’s
```

still	out	on	that	one.”

Oh,	the	gallows	humor	in	our	household	now.	Who	knew	Prentiss
girls	had	it	in	them	to	be	even	a	little	bit	funny?

Ashton	drives	me	to	Bayview	and	drops	me	off	out	front.	“Keep
your	chin	up,”	she	advises.	“Don’t	let	that	sanctimonious	control	freak
get	you	down.”

“ _God,_ 	Ash.	I	did	cheat	on	him,	you	know.	He’s	not	unprovoked.”
She	purses	her	lips	in	a	hard	line.	“Still.”
I	get	out	of	the	car	and	try	to	steel	myself	for	the	day.	School	used
to	be	so	easy.	I	belonged	to	everything	without	even	trying.	Now	I’m
barely	hanging	on	to	the	edges	of	who	I	used	to	be,	and	when	I	catch
my	reflection	in	a	window	I	hardly	recognize	the	girl	staring	back	at
me.	She’s	in	my	clothes—the	kind	of	formfitting	top	and	tight	jeans
that	Jake	likes—but	her	hollow	cheeks	and	dead	eyes	don’t	match	the
outfit.

My	hair	looks	tremendous,	though.	At	least	I	have	that	going	for
me.

There’s	only	one	person	who	looks	worse	than	me	at	school,	and
that’s	Janae.	She	must	have	lost	ten	pounds	since	Simon	died,	and	her
skin’s	a	mess.	Her	mascara’s	running	all	the	time,	so	I	guess	she	cries
in	the	bathroom	between	classes	as	much	as	I	do.	It’s	surprising	we
haven’t	run	into	each	other	yet.

I	see	Jake	at	his	locker	almost	as	soon	as	I	enter	the	hallway.	All
the	blood	rushes	out	of	my	head,	making	me	so	light-headed	I	actually
sway	as	I	walk	toward	him.	His	expression	is	calm	and	preoccupied	as
he	twirls	his	combination.	For	a	second	I	hope	everything’s	going	to	be
fine,	 that	 his	 time	 away	 from	 school	 has	 helped	 him	 cool	 off	 and
forgive	me.	“Hi,	Jake,”	I	say.

His	face	changes	in	an	instant	from	neutral	to	livid.	He	yanks	his
locker	open	with	a	scowl	and	pulls	out	an	armful	of	books,	stuffing
them	into	his	backpack.	He	slams	his	locker,	shoulders	his	backpack,
and	turns	away.

“Are	you	ever	going	to	talk	to	me	again?”	I	ask.	My	voice	is	tiny,
breathless.	Pathetic.

```
He	turns	and	gives	me	such	a	hate-filled	look	that	I	step	backward.
```

“Not	if	I	can	help	it.”

_Don’t	cry.	Don’t	cry._ 	Everyone’s	staring	at	me	as	Jake	stalks	away.
I	catch	Vanessa	smirking	from	a	few	lockers	over.	She’s	 _loving_ 	this.
How	did	I	ever	think	she	was	my	friend?	She’ll	probably	go	after	Jake
soon,	if	she	hasn’t	already.	I	stumble	in	front	of	my	own	locker,	my
hand	stretching	toward	the	lock.	It	takes	a	few	seconds	for	the	word
written	in	thick	black	Sharpie	to	sink	in.

_WHORE._
Muffled	laughter	surrounds	me	as	my	eyes	trace	the	two	 _V_ s	that
make	up	the	 _W._ 	They	cross	each	other	in	a	distinctive,	loopy	scrawl.
I’ve	made	dozens	of	pep	rally	posters	for	the	Bayview	Wildcats	with
Vanessa,	and	teased	her	for	her	funny-looking	 _W_ s.	She	didn’t	even	try
to	hide	it.	I	guess	she	wanted	me	to	know.

I	force	myself	to	walk,	not	run,	to	the	nearest	bathroom.	Two	girls
stand	at	the	mirror,	fixing	their	makeup,	and	I	duck	past	them	into	the
farthest	stall.	I	collapse	onto	the	toilet	seat	and	cry	silently,	burying	my
head	in	my	hands.

The	first	bell	rings	but	I	stay	where	I	am,	tears	rolling	down	my
cheeks	until	I’m	cried	out.	I	fold	my	arms	onto	my	knees	and	lower	my
head,	immobile	as	the	second	bell	rings	and	girls	come	in	and	out	of
the	bathroom	again.	Snatches	of	conversation	float	through	the	room
and,	yeah,	some	of	it’s	about	me.	I	plug	my	ears	and	try	not	to	listen.

It’s	the	middle	of	third	period	by	the	time	I	uncoil	myself	and
stand.	I	unlock	the	stall	door	and	head	for	the	mirror,	pushing	my	hair
away	from	my	face.	My	mascara’s	washed	away,	but	I’ve	been	here	long
enough	that	my	eyes	aren’t	puffy.	I	stare	at	my	reflection	and	try	to
collect	my	scattered	thoughts.	I	can’t	deal	with	classes	today.	I’d	go	to
the	nurse’s	office	and	claim	a	headache,	but	I	don’t	feel	comfortable
there	 now	 that	 I’m	 a	 suspected	 EpiPen	 thief.	 That	 leaves	 only	 one
option:	getting	out	of	here	and	going	home.

I’m	in	the	back	stairwell	with	my	hand	on	the	door	when	heavy
footsteps	pound	the	stairs.	I	turn	to	see	TJ	Forrester	coming	down;	his
nose	is	still	swollen	and	framed	by	a	black	eye.	He	stops	when	he	sees
me,	one	hand	gripping	the	banister.	“Hey,	Addy.”

```
“Shouldn’t	you	be	in	class?”
“I	have	a	doctor’s	appointment.”	He	puts	a	hand	to	his	nose	and
```

grimaces.	“I	might	have	a	deviated	septum.”

“Serves	you	right.”	The	bitter	words	burst	out	before	I	can	stop
them.

TJ’s	mouth	falls	open,	then	closes,	and	his	Adam’s	apple	bobs	up
and	down.	“I	didn’t	say	anything	to	Jake,	Addy.	I	swear	to	God.	I	didn’t
want	this	to	come	out	any	more	than	you	did.	It’s	messed	things	up	for
me	too.”	He	touches	his	nose	again	gingerly.

I	wasn’t	actually	thinking	about	Jake;	I	was	thinking	about	Simon.
But	of	course	TJ	wouldn’t	know	anything	about	the	unpublished	posts.
How	did	Simon	know,	though?	“We	were	the	only	two	people	there,”	I
hedge.	“You	must	have	told	 _somebody._ ”

TJ	shakes	his	head,	wincing	as	though	the	movement	hurts.	“We
were	kissing	on	a	public	beach	before	we	got	to	my	house,	remember?
Anyone	could	have	seen	us.”

“But	they	wouldn’t	have	known—”	I	stop,	realizing	Simon’s	site
never	said	TJ	and	I	slept	together.	He	 _implied_ 	it,	pretty	heavily,	but
that	 was	 it.	 Maybe	 I’d	 overconfessed.	 The	 thought	 sickens	 me,
although	I’m	not	sure	I	could	have	managed	to	tell	Jake	only	a	half-
truth	anyway.	He’d	have	gotten	it	out	of	me	eventually.

TJ	looks	at	me	with	regret	in	his	eyes.	“I’m	sorry	this	sucks	so	bad
for	you.	For	what	it’s	worth,	I	think	Jake’s	being	a	jerk.	But	I	didn’t	tell
anybody.”	He	puts	a	hand	over	his	heart.	“Swear	on	my	granddad’s
grave.	I	know	that	doesn’t	mean	anything	to	you	but	it	does	to	me.”	I
finally	nod,	and	he	lets	out	a	deep	breath.	“Where	are	you	going?”

“Home.	I	can’t	stand	being	here.	All	my	friends	hate	me.”	I’m	not
sure	why	I’m	telling	him	this,	other	than	the	fact	that	I	don’t	have
anyone	else	to	tell.	“I	doubt	they’ll	even	let	me	sit	with	them	now	that
Jake’s	 back.”	 It’s	 true.	 Cooper’s	 out	 today,	 visiting	 his	 sick
grandmother	and	probably,	although	he	didn’t	say	so,	meeting	with	his
lawyer.	With	him	gone	nobody	will	dare	stand	up	to	Jake’s	anger.	Or
want	to.

“Screw	them.”	TJ	gives	me	a	lopsided	grin.	“If	they’re	still	being
assholes	tomorrow,	come	sit	with	me.	They	wanna	talk,	let’s	give	them
something	to	talk	about.”

```
It	shouldn’t	make	me	smile,	but	it	almost	does.

**Bronwyn**

**Thursday,	October	4,	12:20	p.m.**

I	got	lulled	into	a	false	sense	of	complacency.

It	 happens,	 I	 guess,	 even	 during	 the	 worst	 week	 of	 your	 life.
Horrible,	earth-shattering	stuff	piles	on	top	of	you	until	you’re	about	to
suffocate	and	then—it	stops.	And	nothing	else	happens,	so	you	start	to
relax	and	think	you’re	in	the	clear.

That’s	 a	 rookie	 mistake	 that	 smacks	 me	 in	 the	 face	 Thursday
during	lunch	when	the	usual	low-grade	cafeteria	buzz	suddenly	grows
and	swells.	At	first	I	look	around,	interested,	like	anyone	would	be,	and
wondering	 why	 everyone’s	 suddenly	 pulled	 out	 their	 phones.	 But
before	 I	 can	 take	 mine	 out,	 I	 notice	 the	 heads	 swiveling	 in	 my
direction.

“Oh.”	Maeve	is	quicker	than	me,	and	her	soft	exhalation	as	she
scans	her	phone	is	loaded	with	so	much	regret	that	my	heart	sinks.	She
catches	her	bottom	lip	between	her	teeth	and	wrinkles	her	forehead.
“Bronwyn.	It’s,	um,	another	Tumblr.	About...well.	Here.”

I	take	her	phone,	heart	pounding,	and	read	the	exact	same	words
Detective	Mendoza	showed	me	on	Sunday	after	Simon’s	funeral.	 _First
time	this	app	has	ever	featured	good-girl	BR,	possessor	of	school’s
most	perfect	academic	record..._

It’s	all	there.	Simon’s	unpublished	entries	for	each	of	us,	with	an
added	note	at	the	bottom:

```
Did	you	think	I	was	joking	about	killing	Simon?	Read	it	and	weep,	kids.
Everyone	in	detention	with	Simon	last	week	had	an	extraspecial	reason	for
wanting	him	gone.	Exhibit	A:	the	posts	above,	which	he	was	about	to	publish
on	About	That.
Now	here’s	your	assignment:	connect	the	dots.	Is	everybody	in	it	together,
or	is	somebody	pulling	strings?	Who’s	the	puppet	master	and	who’s	the
puppet?
```

```
I’ll	give	you	a	hint	to	get	you	started:	everyone’s	lying.
GO!
```
I	raise	my	eyes	and	lock	on	Maeve’s.	She	knows	the	truth,	all	of	it,
but	I	haven’t	told	Yumiko	or	Kate.	Because	I	thought	maybe	this	could
stay	contained,	quiet,	while	the	police	ran	their	investigation	in	the
background	and	then	closed	it	out	from	lack	of	evidence.

I’m	pathetically	naïve.	Obviously.
“Bronwyn?”	I	can	barely	hear	Yumiko	over	the	roaring	in	my	ears.
“Is	this	for	real?”

“ _Fuck_ 	this	Tumblr	bullshit.”	I’d	be	startled	at	Maeve’s	language	if	I
hadn’t	vaulted	over	my	surprise	threshold	two	minutes	ago.	“I	bet	I
could	hack	that	stupid	thing	and	figure	out	who’s	behind	it.”

“Maeve,	no!”	My	voice	is	so	 _loud._ 	I	lower	it	and	switch	to	Spanish.
“No	lo	hagas...No	queremos...”

I	force	myself	to	stop	talking	as	Kate	and	Yumiko	keep	staring	at
me.	 _You	can’t.	We	don’t	want._ 	That	should	be	enough,	for	now.

But	Maeve	won’t	shut	up.	“I	don’t	care,”	she	says	furiously.	“ _You_
might,	but	I—”

Saved	 by	 the	 loudspeaker.	 Sort	 of.	 Déjà	 vu	 seizes	 me	 as	 a
disembodied	voice	floats	through	the	room:	 _“Attention,	please.	Would
Cooper	Clay,	Nate	Macauley,	Adelaide	Prentiss,	and	Bronwyn	Rojas
please	 report	 to	 the	 main	 office.	 Cooper	 Clay,	 Nate	 Macauley,
Adelaide	Prentiss,	and	Bronwyn	Rojas	to	the	main	office.”_

I	don’t	remember	getting	to	my	feet,	but	I	must	have,	because	here
I	am,	moving.	Shuffling	like	a	zombie	past	the	stares	and	whispers,
weaving	 through	 tables	 until	 I	 get	 to	 the	 cafeteria	 exit.	 Down	 the
hallway,	past	homecoming	posters	that	are	three	weeks	old	now.	Our
planning	committee	is	slacking,	which	would	inspire	more	disdain	if	I
weren’t	on	it.

When	I	get	to	the	main	office,	the	receptionist	gestures	toward	the
conference	room	with	the	weary	wave	of	someone	who	thinks	I	should
know	the	drill	by	now.	I’m	the	last	to	arrive—at	least,	I	think	I	am,
unless	Bayview	Police	or	school	committee	members	are	joining	us.
“Close	the	door,	Bronwyn,”	Principal	Gupta	says.	I	comply	and	sidle
past	her	to	take	a	seat	between	Nate	and	Addy,	across	from	Cooper.


Principal	Gupta	steeples	her	fingers	under	her	chin.	“I’m	sure	I
don’t	have	to	tell	you	why	you’re	here.	We’ve	been	keeping	an	eye	on
that	repulsive	Tumblr	site	and	got	today’s	update	as	soon	as	you	did.	At
the	 same	 time,	 we’ve	 had	 a	 request	 from	 the	 Bayview	 Police
Department	to	make	the	student	body	available	for	interviews	starting
tomorrow.	My	understanding,	based	on	conversations	with	police,	is
that	 today’s	 Tumblr	 is	 an	 accurate	 reflection	 of	 posts	 Simon	 wrote
before	he	died.	I	realize	most	of	you	now	have	legal	representation,
which	of	course	the	school	respects.	But	this	is	a	safe	space.	If	there’s
anything	 you’d	 like	 to	 tell	 me	 that	 might	 help	 the	 school	 better
understand	the	pressures	you	were	facing,	now	is	the	time.”

I	stare	at	her	as	my	knees	start	to	tremble.	Is	she	for	real?	Now	is
most	definitely	 _not_ 	the	time.	Still,	I	feel	this	almost	irresistible	urge	to
answer	 her,	 to	 explain	 myself,	 until	 a	 hand	 under	 the	 table	 grasps
mine.	Nate	doesn’t	look	at	me,	but	his	fingers	thread	through	mine,
warm	and	strong,	resting	against	my	shaking	leg.	He’s	in	his	Guinness
T-shirt	 again,	 and	 the	 material	 stretches	 thin	 and	 soft	 across	 his
shoulders,	as	though	it’s	been	through	hundreds	of	washes.	I	glance	at
him	and	he	gives	a	tiny,	almost	imperceptible	shake	of	his	head.

“Ah	 got	 nothin’	 more	 to	 say	 than	 what	 ah	 told	 ya	 last	 week,”
Cooper	drawls.

“Me	either,”	Addy	says	quickly.	Her	eyes	are	red-rimmed	and	she
looks	exhausted,	her	pixie	features	pinched.	She’s	so	pale,	I	notice	the
light	dusting	of	freckles	across	her	nose	for	the	first	time.	Or	maybe
she’s	just	not	wearing	makeup.	I	think	with	a	stab	of	sympathy	that
she’s	been	the	hardest	hit	of	anyone	so	far.

“I	hardly	think—”	Principal	Gupta	begins,	when	the	door	opens
and	the	receptionist	sticks	her	head	in.

“Bayview	Police	on	line	one,”	she	says,	and	Principal	Gupta	gets	to
her	feet.

“Excuse	me	for	a	moment.”
She	closes	the	door	behind	her	and	the	four	of	us	sit	in	strained
silence,	listening	to	the	hum	of	the	air	conditioner.	It’s	the	first	time
we’ve	all	been	in	one	room	together	since	Officer	Budapest	questioned
us	last	week.	I	almost	laugh	when	I	remember	how	clueless	we	were
then,	arguing	about	unfair	detentions	and	junior	prom	court.

```
Although	to	be	fair,	that	was	mostly	me.
```

Nate	lets	go	of	my	hand	and	tips	his	chair	back,	surveying	the
room.	“Well.	This	is	awkward.”

“Are	you	guys	all	right?”	My	words	come	out	in	a	rush,	surprising
me.	I’m	not	sure	what	I	intended	to	say,	but	that	wasn’t	it.	“This	is
unreal.	That	they—suspect	us.”

“It	 was	 an	 accident,”	 Addy	 says	 immediately.	 Not	 like	 she’s
positive,	though.	More	like	she’s	testing	a	theory.

Cooper	slides	his	eyes	over	to	Nate.	“Weird	kind	of	accident.	How
does	peanut	oil	get	in	a	cup	all	by	itself?”

“Maybe	someone	came	into	the	room	at	some	point	and	we	didn’t
notice,”	 I	 say,	 and	 Nate	 rolls	 his	 eyes	 at	 me.	 “I	 know	 it	 sounds
ridiculous,	 but—you	 have	 to	 consider	 everything,	 right?	 It’s	 not
impossible.”

“Lots	of	people	hated	Simon,”	Addy	says.	From	the	hard	set	of	her
jaw,	she’s	one	of	them.	“He	ruined	plenty	of	lives.	You	guys	remember
Aiden	Wu?	In	our	class,	transferred	sophomore	year?”	I’m	the	only	one
who	nods,	so	Addy	turns	her	gaze	on	me.	“My	sister	knows	his	sister
from	 college.	 Aiden	 didn’t	 transfer	 for	 the	 hell	 of	 it.	 He	 had	 a
breakdown	after	Simon	posted	about	his	cross-dressing.”

“Seriously?”	Nate	asks.	Cooper	runs	a	hand	back	and	forth	over
his	hair.

“You	remember	those	spotlight	posts	Simon	used	to	do	when	he
first	launched	the	app?”	Addy	asks.	“More	in-depth	stuff,	like	a	blog,
almost?”

My	throat	gets	tight.	“I	remember.”
“Well,	he	did	that	with	Aiden,”	Addy	says.	“It	was	straight-up	evil.”
Something	about	her	tone	makes	me	uneasy.	I	never	thought	I’d	hear
shallow	little	Addy	Prentiss	speak	with	such	venom	in	her	voice.	Or
have	an	opinion	of	her	own.

Cooper	jumps	in	hastily,	like	he’s	worried	she’s	going	to	go	off	on	a
rant.	“That’s	what	Leah	Jackson	said	at	the	memorial	service.	I	ran	into
her	under	the	bleachers.	She	said	we	were	all	hypocrites	for	treating
him	like	some	kind	of	martyr.”

“Well,	there	you	go,”	Nate	says.	“You	were	right,	Bronwyn.	The
entire	school’s	probably	been	walking	around	with	bottles	of	peanut	oil


in	their	backpacks,	waiting	for	their	chance.”

“Not	just	any	peanut	oil,”	Addy	says,	and	we	all	turn	to	her.	“It
would	have	to	be	cold-pressed	for	a	person	with	allergies	to	react	to	it.
The	gourmet	type,	basically.”

Nate	stares	at	her,	brow	creased.	“How	would	you	know	that?”
Addy	shrugs.	“I	saw	it	on	the	Food	Network	once.”
“Maybe	that’s	the	sort	of	thing	you	keep	to	yourself	when	Gupta
comes	back,”	Nate	suggests,	and	the	ghost	of	a	grin	flits	across	Addy’s
face.

Cooper	glares	at	Nate.	“This	isn’t	a	joke.”
Nate	yawns,	unperturbed.	“Feels	like	it	sometimes.”
I	swallow	hard,	my	mind	still	churning	through	the	conversation.
Leah	 and	 I	 were	 friendly	 once—we	 partnered	 in	 a	 Model	 United
Nations	competition	that	brought	us	to	the	state	finals	at	the	beginning
of	junior	year.	Simon	had	wanted	to	participate	too,	but	we	told	him
the	wrong	application	deadline	and	he	missed	the	cutoff.	It	wasn’t	on
purpose,	but	he	never	believed	that	and	was	furious	with	both	of	us.	A
few	weeks	later	he	started	writing	about	Leah’s	sex	life	on	About	That.
Usually	Simon	posted	something	once	and	let	it	go,	but	with	Leah,	he
kept	the	updates	coming.	It	was	personal.	I’m	sure	he’d	have	done	the
same	to	me	if	there	had	been	anything	to	find	back	then.

When	Leah	started	sliding	off	the	rails,	she	asked	me	if	I’d	misled
Simon	on	purpose.	I	hadn’t	but	still	felt	guilty,	especially	once	she	slit
her	 wrists.	 Nothing	 was	 the	 same	 for	 her	 after	 Simon	 started	 his
campaign	against	her.

I	don’t	know	what	going	through	something	like	that	does	to	a
person.

Principal	 Gupta	 comes	 back	 into	 the	 room,	 shutting	 the	 door
behind	her	and	settling	into	her	seat.	“My	apologies,	but	that	couldn’t
wait.	Where	were	we?”

Silence	 falls	 for	 a	 few	 seconds,	 until	 Cooper	 clears	 his	 throat.
“With	all	due	respect,	ma’am,	I	think	we	were	agreeing	we	can’t	have
this	conversation.”	There’s	a	steel	in	his	voice	that	wasn’t	there	before,
and	in	an	instant	I	feel	the	energy	of	the	room	coalesce	and	shift.	We
don’t	trust	one	another,	that’s	pretty	obvious—but	we	trust	Principal


Gupta	and	the	Bayview	Police	Department	even	less.	She	sees	it	too
and	pushes	her	chair	back.

“It’s	important	you	know	this	door	is	always	open	to	you,”	she
says,	 but	 we’re	 already	 getting	 to	 our	 feet	 and	 opening	 the	 door
ourselves.

```

```
I’m	out	of	sorts	and	anxious	for	the	rest	of	the	day,	going	through	the
motions	of	everything	I’m	supposed	to	do	at	school	and	at	home.	But	I
can’t	relax,	not	really,	until	the	clock	inches	past	midnight	and	the
phone	Nate	gave	me	rings.

He’s	called	me	every	night	since	Monday,	always	around	the	same
time.	He’s	told	me	things	I	couldn’t	have	imagined	about	his	mother’s
illness	and	his	father’s	drinking.	I’ve	told	him	about	Maeve’s	cancer
and	 the	 nameless	 pressure	 I’ve	 always	 felt	 to	 be	 twice	 as	 good	 at
everything.	Sometimes	we	don’t	talk	at	all.	Last	night	he	suggested	we
watch	a	movie,	and	we	both	logged	in	to	Netflix	and	watched	a	god-
awful	horror	movie	he	picked	until	two	in	the	morning.	I	fell	asleep
with	my	earbuds	still	in,	and	might	have	snored	in	his	ear	at	some
point.

“Your	 turn	 to	 pick	 a	 movie,”	 he	 says	 by	 way	 of	 greeting.	 I’ve
noticed	that	about	Nate;	he	doesn’t	do	pleasantries.	Just	starts	with
whatever’s	on	his	mind.

My	mind’s	elsewhere,	though.	“I’m	looking,”	I	say,	and	we’re	silent
for	 a	 minute	 as	 I	 scroll	 through	 Netflix	 titles	 without	 really	 seeing
them.	It’s	no	good;	I	can’t	go	straight	into	movie	mode.	“Nate,	are	you
in	trouble	because	of	how	everything	came	out	at	school	today?”	After	I
left	Principal	Gupta’s	office,	the	rest	of	the	afternoon	was	a	blur	of
stares,	 whispers,	 and	 uncomfortable	 conversations	 with	 Kate	 and
Yumiko	once	I	finally	explained	what	had	been	going	on	for	the	past
few	days.

He	 snorts	 a	 short	 laugh.	 “I	 was	 in	 trouble	 before.	 Nothing’s
changed.”

“My	friends	are	mad	at	me	for	not	telling	them.”
“About	cheating?	Or	being	investigated	by	the	police?”
“Both.	 I	 hadn’t	 said	 anything	 about	 either.	 I	 thought	 maybe	 it
would	all	go	away	and	they’d	never	have	to	know.”	Robin	had	said	not


to	answer	any	questions	about	the	case,	but	I	didn’t	see	how	I	could
apply	that	to	my	two	best	friends.	When	the	whole	school’s	starting	to
turn	against	you,	you	need	 _somebody_ 	on	your	side.	“I	wish	I	could
remember	 more	 about	 that	 day.	 What	 class	 were	 you	 in	 when	 Mr.
Avery	found	the	phone	in	your	backpack?”

“Physical	 science,”	 Nate	 says.	 “Science	 for	 dummies,	 in	 other
words.	You?”

“Independent	 study,”	 I	 say,	 chewing	 the	 sides	 of	 my	 cheeks.
Ironically	enough,	my	stellar	grades	in	chemistry	let	me	construct	my
own	science	course	senior	year.	“I	suppose	Simon	would’ve	been	in	AP
physics.	I	don’t	know	what	classes	Addy	and	Cooper	have	with	Mr.
Avery,	but	in	detention	they	acted	surprised	to	see	each	other.”

“So?”	Nate	asks.
“Well,	they’re	friends,	right?	You’d	think	they’d	have	talked	about
it.	Or	even	been	in	the	same	class	when	it	happened.”

“Who	knows.	Could’ve	been	homeroom	or	study	period	for	one	of
them.	Avery’s	a	jack-of-all-trades,”	Nate	says.	When	I	don’t	reply,	he
adds,	“What,	you	think	those	two	masterminded	the	whole	thing?”

“Just	following	a	train	of	thought,”	I	say.	“I	feel	like	the	police	are
barely	paying	attention	to	how	weird	that	phone	situation	is,	because
they’re	so	sure	we’re	all	in	it	together.	I	mean,	when	you	think	about	it,
Mr.	Avery	knows	better	than	anyone	what	classes	we	have	with	him.
Maybe	 _he_ 	did	it.	Planted	phones	in	all	our	backpacks	and	coated	the
cups	with	peanut	oil	before	we	got	there.	He’s	a	science	teacher;	he’d
know	how	to	do	that.”

Even	as	I	say	it,	though,	the	mental	image	of	our	frail,	mousy
teacher	manically	doctoring	cups	before	detention	doesn’t	ring	true.
Neither	does	Cooper	making	off	with	the	school’s	EpiPens,	or	Addy
hatching	a	murder	scheme	while	watching	the	Food	Network.

But	I	don’t	really	know	any	of	them.	Including	Nate.	Even	though
it	feels	like	I	do.

“Anything’s	possible,”	Nate	says.	“You	pick	a	movie	yet?”
I’m	tempted	to	choose	something	cool	and	art	house-y	to	impress
him,	except	he’d	probably	see	right	through	it.	Plus	he	picked	a	crap
horror	 movie,	 so	 there’s	 not	 a	 lot	 to	 live	 up	 to.	 “Have	 you	 seen
_Divergent_ ?”


“No.”	His	tone	is	wary.	“And	I	don’t	want	to.”
“Tough.	I	didn’t	want	to	watch	a	bunch	of	people	get	killed	by	a
mist	created	from	an	alien	tear	in	the	space-time	continuum,	but	I
did.”

“Damn	it.”	Nate	sounds	resigned.	He	pauses,	then	asks,	“You	have
it	buffered?”

```
“Yes.	Hit	Play.”	And	we	do.
```

**Cooper**

**Friday,	October	5,	3:30	p.m.**

I	pick	Lucas	up	after	school	and	stop	by	Nonny’s	hospital	room	before
our	parents	get	there.	She’d	been	asleep	most	of	the	time	we	visited	all
week,	but	today	she’s	sitting	up	in	bed	with	the	TV	remote	in	hand.
“This	television	only	gets	three	channels,”	she	complains	as	Lucas	and
I	hover	in	the	doorway.	“We	might	as	well	be	in	1985.	And	the	food	is
terrible.	Lucas,	do	you	have	any	candy?”

“No,	ma’am,”	Lucas	says,	flipping	his	too-long	hair	out	of	his	eyes.
Nonny	turns	a	hopeful	face	to	me,	and	I’m	struck	by	how	 _old_ 	she	looks.
I	mean,	sure,	she’s	well	into	her	eighties,	but	she’s	always	had	so	much
energy	that	I	never	really	noticed.	It	hits	me	now	that	even	though	her
doctor	says	she’s	recovering	well,	we’ll	be	lucky	to	go	a	few	years	before
something	like	this	happens	again.

And	then	at	some	point,	she’s	not	gonna	be	around	at	all.
“I	got	nothin’.	Sorry,”	I	say,	dropping	my	head	to	hide	my	stinging
eyes.

Nonny	lets	out	a	theatrical	sigh.	“Well,	goddamn.	You	boys	are
pretty,	but	not	helpful	from	a	practical	standpoint.”	She	rummages	on
the	side	table	next	to	her	bed	and	finds	a	rumpled	twenty-dollar	bill.
“Lucas,	go	downstairs	to	the	gift	shop	and	buy	three	Snickers	bars.	One
for	each	of	us.	Keep	the	change	and	take	your	time.”

“Yes,	ma’am.”	Lucas’s	eyes	gleam	as	he	calculates	his	profit.	He’s
out	 the	 door	 in	 a	 flash,	 and	 Nonny	 settles	 back	 against	 a	 stack	 of
hospital	pillows.

“Off	he	goes	to	pad	his	pockets,	bless	his	mercenary	little	heart,”
she	says	fondly.

```
“Are	you	supposed	to	be	eating	candy	right	now?”	I	ask.
“Of	 course	 not.	 But	 I	 want	 to	 hear	 how	 you’re	 doing,	 darlin’.
```

Nobody	tells	me	anything	but	I	hear	things.”

I	lower	myself	into	the	side	chair	next	to	her	bed,	eyes	on	the	floor.
I	don’t	trust	myself	to	look	at	her	yet.	“You	should	rest,	Nonny.”

“Cooper,	 this	 was	 the	 least	 dangerous	 heart	 attack	 in	 cardiac
history.	A	blip	on	the	monitor.	Too	much	bacon,	that’s	all.	Catch	me	up
on	 the	 Simon	 Kelleher	 situation.	 I	 promise	 you	 it	 will	 not	 cause	 a
relapse.”

I	blink	a	few	times	and	imagine	myself	getting	ready	to	throw	a
slider:	straightening	my	wrist,	placing	my	fingers	on	the	outer	portion
of	the	baseball,	letting	the	ball	roll	off	my	thumb	and	index	finger.	It
works;	my	eyes	dry	and	my	breathing	evens	out,	and	I	can	finally	meet
Nonny’s	eyes.	“It’s	a	goddamn	mess.”

She	sighs	and	pats	my	hand.	“Oh,	darlin’.	Of	course	it	is.”
I	tell	her	everything:	How	Simon’s	rumors	about	us	are	all	over
school	 now,	 and	 how	 the	 police	 set	 up	 shop	 in	 the	 administrative
offices	today	and	interviewed	everybody	we	know.	Plus	lots	of	people
we	don’t	know.	How	Coach	Ruffalo	hasn’t	pulled	me	aside	yet	to	ask
whether	I’m	on	the	juice	but	I’m	sure	he	will	soon.	How	we	had	a	sub
for	astronomy	because	Mr.	Avery	was	holed	up	in	another	room	with
two	police	officers.	Whether	he	was	being	questioned	like	we’d	been	or
giving	some	kind	of	evidence	against	us,	I	couldn’t	tell.

Nonny	shakes	her	head	when	I	finish.	She	can’t	set	her	hair	here
the	way	she	does	at	home,	and	it	bobs	around	like	loose	cotton.	“I
could	not	be	sorrier	you	got	pulled	into	this,	Cooper.	You	of	all	people.
It’s	not	right.”

I	 wait	 for	 her	 to	 ask	 me,	 but	 she	 doesn’t.	 So	 I	 finally	 say—
tentatively,	because	after	spending	days	with	lawyers	it	feels	wrong	to
state	anything	like	an	actual	fact—“I	didn’t	do	what	they	say,	Nonny.	I
didn’t	use	steroids	and	I	didn’t	hurt	Simon.”

“Well,	for	goodness’	sake,	Cooper.”	Nonny	brushes	impatiently	at
her	hospital	blanket.	“You	don’t	have	to	tell	 _me_ 	that.”

I	swallow	hard.	Somehow,	the	fact	that	Nonny	accepts	my	word
without	question	makes	me	feel	guilty.	“The	lawyer’s	costing	a	fortune
and	she’s	not	helping.	Nothing’s	getting	better.”

“Things’ll	get	worse	before	they	get	better,”	Nonny	says	placidly.
“That’s	how	it	goes.	And	don’t	you	worry	about	the	cost.	I’m	payin’	for


it.”

A	fresh	wave	of	guilt	hits	me.	“Can	you	afford	that?”
“Course	I	can.	Your	grandfather	and	I	bought	a	lot	of	Apple	stock
in	the	nineties.	Just	because	I	didn’t	hand	it	all	over	to	your	father	to
buy	 a	 McMansion	 in	 this	 overpriced	 town	 doesn’t	 mean	 I	 couldn’t
have.	Now.	Tell	me	something	I	 _don’t_ 	know.”

I’m	not	sure	what	she	means.	I	could	mention	how	Jake	is	freezing
out	Addy	and	all	our	friends	are	joining	in,	but	that’s	too	depressing.
“Not	much	else	to	tell,	Nonny.”

“How’s	Keely	handling	all	this?”
“Like	a	vine.	Clingy,”	I	say	before	I	can	stop	myself.	Then	I	feel
horrible.	Keely’s	been	nothing	but	supportive,	and	it’s	not	her	fault	that
makes	me	feel	suffocated.

“Cooper.”	Nonny	takes	my	hand	in	both	of	hers.	They’re	small	and
light,	threaded	with	thick	blue	veins.	“Keely	is	a	beautiful,	sweet	girl.
But	if	she’s	not	who	you	love,	she’s	just	 _not._ 	And	that’s	fine.”

My	throat	goes	dry	and	I	stare	at	the	game	show	on	the	screen.
Somebody’s	about	to	win	a	new	washer/dryer	set	and	they’re	pretty
happy	about	it.	Nonny	doesn’t	say	anything	else,	just	keeps	holding	my
hand.	“I	dunno	whatcha	mean,”	I	say.

If	Nonny	notices	my	good	ol’	boy	accent	coming	and	going,	she
doesn’t	mention	it.	“I	mean,	Cooper	Clay,	I’ve	been	in	the	room	when
that	girl	calls	or	texts	you,	and	you	always	look	like	you’re	trying	to
escape.	 Then	 someone	 else	 calls	 and	 your	 face	 lights	 up	 like	 a
Christmas	tree.	I	don’t	know	what’s	holding	you	back,	darlin’,	but	I
wish	you’d	stop	letting	it.	It’s	not	fair	to	you	 _or_ 	to	Keely.”	She	squeezes
my	hand	and	releases	it.	“We	don’t	have	to	talk	about	it	now.	In	fact,
could	you	please	hunt	down	that	brother	of	yours?	It	may	not	have
been	 the	 best	 idea	 I	 ever	 had	 to	 let	 a	 twelve-year-old	 wander	 the
hospital	with	money	burning	a	hole	in	his	pocket.”

“Yeah,	sure.”	She’s	letting	me	off	the	hook	and	we	both	know	it.	I
stand	up	and	ease	out	of	the	room	into	a	hallway	crowded	with	nurses
in	brightly	colored	scrubs.	Every	one	of	them	stops	what	they’re	doing
and	smiles	at	me.	“You	need	help,	hon?”	the	one	closest	to	me	asks.

It’s	been	that	way	my	whole	life.	People	see	me	and	immediately
think	the	best	of	me.	Once	they	know	me,	they	like	me	even	more.


If	it	ever	came	out	that	I’d	actually	done	something	to	Simon,
plenty	of	people	would	hate	me.	But	there’d	also	be	people	who’d	make
excuses	for	me,	and	say	there	must	be	more	to	my	story	than	just
getting	accused	of	using	steroids.

```
The	thing	is,	they’d	be	right.

**Nate**

**Friday,	October	5,	11:30	p.m.**

My	father’s	awake	for	a	change	when	I	get	home	Friday	from	a	party	at
Amber’s	house.	It	was	still	going	strong	when	I	left,	but	I’d	had	enough.
I’ve	got	ramen	noodles	on	the	stove	and	toss	some	vegetables	into
Stan’s	cage.	As	usual	he	just	blinks	at	them	like	an	ingrate.

“You’re	home	early,”	my	father	says.	He	looks	the	same	as	ever—
like	hell.	Bloated	and	wrinkled	with	a	pasty,	yellow	tinge	to	his	skin.
His	hand	shakes	when	he	lifts	his	glass.	A	couple	of	months	ago	I	came
home	one	night	and	he	was	barely	breathing,	so	I	called	an	ambulance.
He	spent	a	few	days	in	the	hospital,	where	doctors	told	him	his	liver
was	so	damaged	he	could	drop	dead	at	any	time.	He	nodded	and	acted
like	he	gave	a	shit,	then	came	home	and	cracked	another	bottle	of
Seagram’s.

I’ve	 been	 ignoring	 that	 ambulance	 bill	 for	 weeks.	 It’s	 almost	 a
thousand	dollars	thanks	to	our	crap	insurance,	and	now	that	I	have
zero	income	there’s	even	less	chance	we	can	pay	it.

“I	have	things	to	do.”	I	dump	the	noodles	into	a	bowl	and	head	for
my	room	with	them.

“Seen	my	phone?”	my	father	calls	after	me.	“Kept	ringing	today
but	I	couldn’t	find	it.”

“That’s	’cause	it’s	not	on	the	couch,”	I	mutter,	and	shut	my	door
behind	me.	He	was	probably	hallucinating.	His	phone	hasn’t	rung	in
months.

I	scarf	down	my	noodles	in	five	minutes,	then	settle	back	onto	my
pillows	and	put	in	my	earbuds	so	I	can	call	Bronwyn.	It’s	my	turn	to
pick	a	movie,	thank	God,	but	we’re	barely	half	an	hour	into	 _Ringu_
when	Bronwyn	decides	she’s	had	enough.

```
“I	can’t	watch	this	alone.	It’s	too	scary,”	she	says.
“You’re	not	alone.	I’m	watching	it	with	you.”
```

“Not	 _with_ 	me.	I	need	a	person	in	the	room	for	something	like	this.
Let’s	watch	something	else	instead.	My	turn	to	pick.”

“I’m	not	watching	another	goddamn	Divergent	movie,	Bronwyn.”	I
wait	a	beat	before	adding,	“You	should	come	over	and	watch	 _Ringu_
with	me.	Climb	out	your	window	and	drive	here.”	I	say	it	like	it’s	a	joke,
and	it	mostly	is.	Unless	she	says	yes.

Bronwyn	pauses,	and	I	can	tell	she’s	thinking	about	it	as	a	not-
joke.	“My	window’s	a	fifteen-foot	drop	to	the	ground,”	she	says.	 _Joke._

“So	use	a	door.	You’ve	got,	like,	ten	of	them	in	that	house.”	 _Joke._
“My	parents	would	kill	me	if	they	found	out.”	 _Not-joke._ 	Which
means	she’s	considering	it.	I	picture	her	sitting	next	to	me	in	those
little	 shorts	 she	 had	 on	 when	 I	 was	 at	 her	 house,	 her	 leg	 pressed
against	mine,	and	my	breathing	gets	shallow.

“Why	 would	 they?”	 I	 ask.	 “You	 said	 they	 can	 sleep	 through
anything.”	 _Not-joke._ “Come	 on,	 just	 for	 an	 hour	 till	 we	 finish	 the
movie.	You	can	meet	my	lizard.”	It	takes	a	few	seconds	of	silence	for
me	to	realize	how	that	might	be	interpreted.	“That’s	not	a	line.	I	have
an	actual	lizard.	A	bearded	dragon	named	Stan.”

Bronwyn	laughs	so	hard	she	almost	chokes.	“Oh	my	God.	That
would	have	been	completely	out	of	character	and	yet...for	a	second	I
really	did	think	you	meant	something	else.”

I	can’t	help	laughing	too.	“Hey,	girl.	You	were	into	that	smooth
talk.	Admit	it.”

“At	least	it’s	not	an	anaconda,”	Bronwyn	sputters.	I	laugh	harder,
but	I’m	still	kind	of	turned	on.	Weird	combination.

“Come	over,”	I	say.	 _Not-joke._
I	listen	to	her	breathe	for	a	while,	until	she	says,	“I	can’t.”
“Okay.”	I’m	not	disappointed.	I	never	really	thought	she	would.
“But	you	need	to	pick	a	different	movie.”

We	agree	on	the	last	Bourne	movie	and	I’m	watching	it	with	my
eyes	half-closed,	listening	to	increasingly	frequent	texts	from	Amber
chime	 in	 the	 background.	 She	 might	 be	 starting	 to	 think	 we’re
something	 we’re	 not.	 I	 reach	 for	 that	 phone	 to	 shut	 it	 down	 when
Bronwyn	says,	“Nate.	Your	phone.”

```
“What?”
```

“Someone	keeps	texting	you.”
“So?”
“So	it’s	really	late.”
“And?”	I	ask,	annoyed.	I	hadn’t	pegged	Bronwyn	as	the	possessive
type,	especially	when	all	we	ever	do	is	talk	on	the	phone	and	she	just
turned	down	my	joke-not-joke	invitation.

“It’s	not...customers,	is	it?”
I	exhale	and	shut	the	other	phone	off.	“No.	I	told	you,	I’m	not
doing	that	anymore.	I’m	not	stupid.”

“All	right.”	She	sounds	relieved,	but	tired.	Her	voice	is	starting	to
drag.	“I	might	go	to	sleep	now.”

“Okay.	Do	you	want	to	hang	up?”
“No.”	She	laughs	thickly,	already	half-asleep.	“I’m	running	out	of
minutes,	though.	I	just	got	a	warning.	I	have	half	an	hour	left.”

Those	prepaid	phones	have	hundreds	of	minutes	on	them,	and
she’s	had	it	less	than	a	week.	I	didn’t	realize	we’d	been	talking	that
much.	 “I’ll	 give	 you	 another	 phone	 tomorrow,”	 I	 tell	 her,	 before	 I
remember	tomorrow’s	Saturday	and	we	don’t	have	school.	“Bronwyn,
wait.	You	need	to	hang	up.”

I	think	she’s	already	asleep	until	she	mutters,	“What?”
“Hang	up,	okay?	So	your	minutes	don’t	run	out	and	I	can	call	you
tomorrow	about	getting	you	another	phone.”

“Oh.	Right.	Okay.	Good	night,	Nate.”
“Good	night.”	I	hang	up	and	place	the	two	phones	side	by	side,
pick	up	the	remote,	and	shut	off	the	TV.	Might	as	well	go	to	sleep.


**Addy**

**Saturday,	October	6,	9:30	a.m.**

I’m	at	home	with	Ashton	and	we’re	trying	to	figure	out	something	to
do.	But	we	keep	getting	stuck	on	the	fact	that	nothing	interests	me.

“Come	 on,	 Addy.”	 I’m	 lying	 across	 an	 armchair,	 and	 Ashton
nudges	me	with	her	foot	from	the	couch.	“What	would	you	normally	do
on	a	weekend?	And	don’t	say	hang	out	with	Jake,”	she	adds	quickly.

“But	that	 _is_ 	what	I’d	do,”	I	whine.	Pathetic,	but	I	can’t	help	it.	I’ve
had	this	awful	sickening	lurch	in	my	stomach	all	week,	as	though	I’d
been	walking	along	a	sturdy	bridge	and	it	vanished	under	my	feet.

“Can	you	honestly	not	come	up	with	a	single,	non-Jake-related
thing	you	like?”

I	shift	in	my	seat	and	consider	the	question.	What	did	I	do	before
Jake?	I	was	fourteen	when	we	started	dating,	still	partly	a	kid.	My	best
friend	was	Rowan	Flaherty,	a	girl	I’d	grown	up	with	who	moved	to
Texas	later	that	year.	We’d	drifted	apart	in	ninth	grade	when	she	had
zero	interest	in	boys,	but	the	summer	before	high	school	we’d	still
ridden	our	bikes	all	over	town	together.	“I	like	riding	my	bike,”	I	say
uncertainly,	even	though	I	haven’t	been	on	one	in	years.

Ashton	claps	her	hands	as	if	I’m	a	reluctant	toddler	she’s	trying	to
get	excited	about	a	new	activity.	“Let’s	do	that!	Ride	bikes	somewhere.”

Ugh,	no.	I	don’t	want	to	move.	I	don’t	have	the	energy.	“I	gave
mine	away	years	ago.	It	was	half-rusted	under	the	porch.	And	you
don’t	have	one	anyway.”

“We’ll	use	those	rental	bikes—what	are	they	called?	Hub	Bikes	or
something?	They’re	all	over	town.	Let’s	find	some.”

I	sigh.	“Ash,	you	can’t	babysit	me	forever.	I	appreciate	you	keeping
me	from	falling	apart	all	week,	but	you’ve	got	a	life.	You	should	get
back	to	Charlie.”


Ashton	doesn’t	answer	right	away.	She	goes	into	the	kitchen,	and	I
hear	the	refrigerator	door	opening	and	the	faint	clink	of	bottles.	When
she	returns	she’s	holding	a	Corona	and	a	San	Pellegrino,	which	she
hands	to	me.	She	ignores	my	raised	eyebrows—it’s	not	even	ten	o’clock
in	the	morning—and	takes	a	long	sip	of	beer	as	she	sits	down,	crossing
her	legs	beneath	her.	“Charlie’s	happy	as	can	be.	I’m	guessing	he’s
moved	his	girlfriend	in	by	now.”

_“What?”_ 	I	forget	how	tired	I	am	and	sit	up	straight.
“I	 caught	 them	 when	 I	 went	 home	 to	 get	 more	 clothes	 last
weekend.	It	was	all	so	horribly	clichéd.	I	even	threw	a	vase	at	his	head.”

“Did	you	hit	him?”	I	ask	hopefully.	And	hypocritically,	I	guess.
After	all,	I’m	the	Charlie	in	my	and	Jake’s	relationship.	She	shakes	her
head	and	takes	another	gulp	of	her	beer.

“Ash.”	I	move	from	my	armchair	and	sit	next	to	her	on	the	couch.
She’s	not	crying,	but	her	eyes	are	shiny,	and	when	I	put	my	hand	on
her	 arm	 she	 swallows	 hard.	 “I’m	 so	 sorry.	 Why	 didn’t	 you	 say
something?”

“You	had	enough	to	worry	about.”
“But	 it’s	 your	 marriage!”	 I	 can’t	 help	 looking	 at	 Ashton	 and
Charlie’s	wedding	photo	from	two	years	ago,	which	sits	next	to	my
junior	prom	picture	on	our	mantel.	They	were	such	a	perfect	couple,
people	used	to	joke	that	they	looked	as	though	they	came	with	the
frame.	Ashton	had	been	so	happy	that	day,	gorgeous	and	glowing	and
giddy.

And	relieved.	I’d	tried	to	squash	the	idea	because	I	knew	it	was
catty,	but	I	couldn’t	help	thinking	Ashton	had	feared	losing	Charlie
right	up	till	the	day	she	married	him.	He	was	 _tremendous_ 	on	paper—
handsome,	good	family,	headed	to	Stanford	Law—and	our	mother	had
been	thrilled.	It	wasn’t	until	they’d	been	married	a	year	that	I	noticed
Ashton	almost	never	laughed	when	Charlie	was	around.

“It’s	been	over	for	a	while,	Addy.	I	should	have	left	six	months	ago,
but	I	was	too	much	of	a	coward.	I	didn’t	want	to	be	alone,	I	guess.	Or
admit	I’d	failed.	I’ll	find	my	own	place	eventually,	but	I’ll	be	here	for	a
while.”	 She	 shoots	 me	 a	 wry	 look.	 “All	 right.	 I’ve	 made	 my	 true
confession.	Now	you	tell	me	something.	Why	did	you	lie	when	Officer
Budapest	asked	about	being	in	the	nurse’s	office	the	day	Simon	died?”


I	let	go	of	her	arm.	“I	didn’t—”
“Addy.	Come	on.	You	started	playing	with	your	hair	as	soon	as	he
brought	it	up.	You	always	do	that	when	you’re	nervous.”	Her	tone’s
matter-of-fact,	not	accusing.	“I	don’t	believe	for	one	second	you	took
those	EpiPens,	so	what	are	you	hiding?”

Tears	prick	my	eyes.	I’m	so	tired,	suddenly,	of	all	the	half-truths
I’ve	piled	up	over	the	past	days	and	weeks.	Months.	 _Years._ 	“It’s	so
stupid,	Ash.”

“Tell	me.”
“I	didn’t	go	for	myself.	I	went	to	get	Tylenol	for	Jake,	because	he
had	a	headache.	And	I	didn’t	want	to	say	so	in	front	of	you	because	I
knew	you’d	give	me	that	 _look._ ”

“What	look?”
“ _You_ 	know.	That	whole	 _Addy-you’re-such-a-doormat_ 	look.”
“I	don’t	think	that,”	Ashton	says	quietly.	A	fat	tear	rolls	down	my
cheek,	and	she	reaches	over	to	brush	it	away.

“You	should.	I	am.”
“Not	 anymore,”	 Ashton	 says,	 and	 that	 does	 it.	 I	 start	 flat-out
bawling,	 curled	 in	 the	 fetal	 position	 in	 a	 corner	 of	 the	 couch	 with
Ashton’s	arms	around	me.	I	don’t	even	know	who	or	what	I’m	crying
for:	Jake,	Simon,	my	friends,	my	mother,	my	sister,	myself.	All	of	the
above,	I	guess.

When	the	tears	finally	stop	I’m	raw	and	exhausted,	my	eyelids	hot
and	my	shoulders	sore	from	shaking	for	so	long.	But	I	feel	lighter	and
cleaner	too,	like	I’ve	purged	something	that’s	been	making	me	sick.
Ashton	gets	me	a	pile	of	Kleenex	and	gives	me	a	minute	to	wipe	my
eyes	and	blow	my	nose.	When	I’ve	finally	wadded	up	all	the	damp
tissues	and	tossed	them	into	a	corner	wastebasket,	she	takes	a	small
sip	of	her	beer	and	wrinkles	her	nose.	“This	doesn’t	taste	as	good	as	I
thought	it	would.	Come	on,	let’s	ride	bikes.”

I	can’t	say	no	to	her	now.	So	I	trail	after	her	to	the	park	a	half	mile
from	our	house,	where	there’s	a	whole	row	of	rental	bikes.	Ashton
figures	out	the	sign-up	deal,	swiping	her	credit	card	to	release	two
bikes.	We	don’t	have	helmets,	but	we’re	just	going	around	the	park	so
it	doesn’t	really	matter.


I	haven’t	ridden	a	bike	in	years	but	I	guess	it’s	true	what	they	say:
you	don’t	forget	how.	After	a	wobbly	start	we	take	off	on	the	wide	path
through	the	park	and	I	have	to	admit,	it’s	kind	of	fun.	The	breeze
flutters	 through	 my	 hair	 as	 my	 legs	 pump	 and	 my	 heart	 rate
accelerates.	It’s	the	first	time	in	a	week	I	haven’t	felt	half-dead.	I’m
surprised	when	Ashton	stops	and	says,	“Hour’s	up.”	She	catches	sight
of	my	face	and	asks,	“Should	we	rent	for	another	hour?”

I	grin	at	her.	“Yeah,	okay.”	We	get	tired	about	halfway	through,
though,	and	return	the	bikes	so	we	can	go	to	a	café	and	rehydrate.
Ashton	gets	our	drinks	while	I	find	seats,	and	I	scroll	through	my
messages	while	I	wait	for	her.	It	takes	a	lot	less	time	than	it	used	to—I
only	have	a	couple	from	Cooper,	asking	if	I’m	going	to	Olivia’s	party
tonight.

Olivia	and	I	have	been	friends	since	freshman	year,	but	she	hasn’t
spoken	to	me	all	week.	 _Pretty	sure	I’m	not	invited,_ 	I	text.

“Only	Girl”	trills	out	with	Cooper’s	response.	I	make	a	mental	note
that	when	all	this	is	over	and	I	have	a	minute	to	think	straight,	I’m
going	to	change	my	text	tone	to	something	less	annoying.	 _That’s	BS.
They’re	your	friends	too._

_Sitting	this	one	out,_ 	I	write.	 _Have	fun._ 	At	this	point,	I’m	not	even
sad	about	being	excluded.	It’s	just	one	more	thing.

Cooper	doesn’t	get	it.	I	guess	I	should	thank	him;	if	he’d	dropped
me	like	everyone	else,	Vanessa	would	have	gone	nuclear	on	me	by	now.
But	she	doesn’t	dare	cross	the	homecoming	king,	even	when	he’s	been
accused	of	steroid	use.	School	opinion	is	split	down	the	middle	about
whether	he	did	it	or	not,	but	he’s	not	saying	either	way.

I	wonder	if	I	could	have	done	the	same—bluffed	and	brazened	my
way	through	this	whole	nightmare	without	telling	Jake	the	truth.	Then
I	look	at	my	sister,	chuckling	with	the	guy	behind	the	coffee	counter	in
a	 way	 she	 never	 did	 with	 Charlie,	 and	 remember	 how	 careful	 and
contained	I	always	had	to	be	around	Jake.	If	I	was	going	to	the	party
tonight	I’d	have	to	wear	something	he	picked	out,	stay	as	late	as	he
wanted,	and	not	talk	to	anyone	who	might	make	him	mad.

```
I	miss	him	still.	I	do.	But	I	don’t	miss	that.
```
**Bronwyn**

**Saturday,	October	6,	10:30	a.m.**


My	 feet	 fly	 over	 the	 familiar	 path	 as	 my	 arms	 and	 legs	 match	 the
rhythm	of	the	music	blaring	in	my	ears.	My	heart	accelerates	and	the
fears	that	have	been	crowding	my	brain	all	week	recede,	replaced	by
pure	physical	effort.	When	I	finish	my	run	I’m	drained	but	pumped	full
of	endorphins,	and	feel	almost	cheerful	as	I	head	for	the	library	to	pick
up	Maeve.	It’s	our	usual	Saturday-morning	routine,	but	I	can’t	find	her
in	any	of	her	typical	spots	and	have	to	text	her.

_Fourth	floor,_ 	she	replies,	so	I	head	for	the	children’s	room.
She’s	sitting	on	a	tiny	chair	near	the	window,	tapping	away	at	one
of	the	computers.	“Revisiting	your	childhood?”	I	ask,	sinking	to	the
floor	beside	her.

“No,”	Maeve	says,	her	eyes	on	the	screen.	She	lowers	her	voice	to
almost	a	whisper.	“I’m	in	the	admin	panel	for	About	That.”

It	takes	a	second	for	what	she	said	to	register,	and	when	it	does	my
heart	 takes	 a	 panicky	 leap.	 “Maeve,	 what	 the	 hell?	 What	 are	 you
doing?”

“Looking	 around.	 Don’t	 freak	 out,”	 she	 adds	 with	 a	 sideways
glance	at	me.	“I’m	not	disturbing	anything,	but	even	if	I	were,	nobody
would	know	it’s	me.	I’m	at	a	public	computer.”

“Using	your	library	card!”	I	hiss.	You	can’t	get	online	here	without
entering	your	account	number.

“No.	Using	his.”	Maeve	inclines	her	head	toward	a	small	boy	a	few
tables	over	with	a	stack	of	picture	books	in	front	of	him.	I	stare	at	her
incredulously,	and	she	shrugs.	“I	didn’t	 _take_ 	it	from	him.	He	left	it
lying	out	and	I	wrote	down	the	numbers.”

The	 little	 boy’s	 mother	 joins	 him	 then,	 smiling	 as	 she	 catches
Maeve’s	eye.	She’d	never	guess	my	sweet-faced	sister	just	committed
identity	theft	against	her	six-year-old.

I	can’t	think	of	anything	to	say	except	“Why?”
“I	wanted	to	see	what	the	police	are	seeing,”	Maeve	says.	“If	there
were	any	other	draft	posts,	other	people	who	might’ve	wanted	to	keep
Simon	quiet.”

I	inch	forward	in	spite	of	myself.	“Were	there?”
“No,	but	there	 _is_ 	something	odd.	About	Cooper’s	post.	It’s	date-
stamped	days	after	everyone	else’s,	for	the	night	before	Simon	died.


There’s	an	earlier	file	with	his	name	on	it,	but	it’s	encrypted	and	I	can’t
open	it.”

“So?”
“I	don’t	know.	But	it’s	different,	which	makes	it	interesting.	I	need
to	come	back	with	a	thumb	drive	and	download	it.”	I	blink	at	her,
trying	to	pinpoint	the	exact	moment	when	she	morphed	into	a	hacker-
investigator.	“There’s	something	else.	Simon’s	user	name	for	the	site	is
AnarchiSK.	I	Googled	it	and	came	up	with	a	bunch	of	4chan	threads	he
posted	to	constantly.	I	didn’t	have	time	to	read	them,	but	we	should.”

“Why?”	I	ask	as	she	loops	her	backpack	over	her	shoulder	and	gets
to	her	feet.

“Because	something’s	weird	about	all	this,”	Maeve	says	matter-of-
factly,	leading	me	out	the	door	and	down	the	stairs.	“Don’t	you	think?”

“Understatement	 of	 the	 year,”	 I	 mutter.	 I	 stop	 in	 the	 empty
stairwell,	so	she	does	too,	half	turning	with	a	questioning	look.	“Maeve,
how’d	you	even	get	into	Simon’s	admin	panel?	How	did	you	know
where	to	look?”

A	small	smile	tugs	at	the	corners	of	her	mouth.	“You’re	not	the
only	 one	 who	 grabs	 confidential	 information	 off	 computers	 other
people	were	using.”

I	 gape	 at	 her.	 “So	 you—so	 Simon	 was	 posting	 About	 That	 at
school?	And	left	it	open?”

“Of	course	not.	Simon	was	smart.	He	did	it	here.	Not	sure	if	it	was
a	one-time	thing	or	if	he	posted	from	the	library	all	the	time,	but	I	saw
him	one	weekend	last	month	when	you	were	running.	He	didn’t	see
me.	I	logged	in	to	the	computer	after	him	and	got	the	address	from	the
browser	history.	I	didn’t	do	anything	with	it	at	first,”	she	says,	meeting
my	incredulous	look	with	a	calm	gaze.	“Just	put	it	aside	for	future
reference.	I	started	trying	to	get	in	after	you	came	back	from	the	police
station.	Don’t	worry,”	she	adds,	patting	me	on	the	arm.	“Not	from
home.	Nobody	can	trace	it.”

“Okay,	but...why	the	interest	in	the	app?	Before	Simon	even	died?
What	were	you	going	to	do?”

Maeve	purses	her	lips	thoughtfully.	“I	hadn’t	figured	that	part	out.
I	 thought	 maybe	 I’d	 start	 wiping	 it	 clean	 right	 after	 he	 posted,	 or
switch	all	the	text	to	Russian.	Or	dismantle	the	whole	thing.”


I	 shift	 my	 feet	 and	 stumble	 a	 little,	 grabbing	 the	 railing	 for
support.	“Maeve,	is	this	because	of	what	happened	freshman	year?”

“No.”	Maeve’s	amber	eyes	get	hard.	“Bronwyn,	you’re	the	one	who
still	thinks	about	that.	Not	me.	I	just	wanted	the	stupid	hold	he	had
over	 the	 entire	 school	 to	 stop.	 And,	 well”—she	 lets	 out	 a	 short,
humorless	laugh	that	echoes	against	the	concrete	walls	of	the	stairwell
—“I	guess	it	did.”	She	starts	back	down	the	stairs	with	long	strides	and
pushes	hard	on	the	exit	when	she	gets	to	the	bottom.	I	follow	her
silently,	trying	to	wrap	my	brain	around	the	fact	that	my	sister	was
keeping	a	secret	from	me	similar	to	the	one	I	kept	from	her.	And	that
both	of	them	tie	back	to	Simon.

Maeve	 gives	 me	 a	 sunny	 smile	 when	 we	 get	 outside,	 as	 if	 the
conversation	we	just	had	never	happened.	“Bayview	Estates	is	on	our
way	home.	Should	we	pick	up	your	forbidden	technology?”

“We	could	try.”	I’ve	told	Maeve	all	about	Nate,	who	called	this
morning	to	say	he’d	leave	a	phone	in	the	mailbox	of	5	Bayview	Estate
Road.	It’s	part	of	a	new	development	of	half-built	houses,	and	the	area
tends	to	be	deserted	on	weekends.	“I’m	not	sure	how	early	Nate	gets
moving	on	a	Saturday,	though.”

We	reach	Bayview	Estates	in	less	than	fifteen	minutes,	turning
into	a	street	filled	with	boxy,	half-finished	houses.	Maeve	puts	a	hand
on	my	arm	as	we	approach	number	5.	“Let	me	go,”	she	says	with	a
forbidding	air,	eyes	darting	around	dramatically	as	though	the	Bayview
Police	could	descend	with	sirens	blaring	at	any	minute.	 _“Just	in	case.”_

“Have	at	it,”	I	mutter.	We’re	probably	too	early	anyway.	It’s	barely
eleven.

But	Maeve	returns	waving	a	small	black	device	with	a	triumphant
flourish,	laughing	when	I	yank	it	from	her.	“Eager	much,	nerd?”	When
I	power	it	up	there’s	one	message,	and	I	open	it	to	a	picture	of	a	yellow-
brown	lizard	sitting	placidly	on	a	rock	in	the	middle	of	a	large	cage.
_Actual	lizard,_ 	reads	the	caption,	and	I	laugh	out	loud.

“Oh	my	God,”	Maeve	mutters,	peering	over	my	shoulder.	“Private
jokes.	You’re	 _soooo_ 	into	him,	aren’t	you?”

```
I	don’t	have	to	answer	her.	It’s	a	rhetorical	question.
```
**Cooper**

**Saturday,	October	6,	9:20	p.m.**


By	 the	 time	 I	 get	 to	 Olivia’s	 party,	 nearly	 everyone’s	 out	 of	 it.
Somebody’s	puking	in	the	bushes	as	I	push	open	the	front	door.	I	spot
Keely	 huddled	 next	 to	 the	 stairs	 with	 Olivia,	 having	 one	 of	 those
intense	conversations	girls	get	into	when	they’re	wasted.	A	few	juniors
are	toking	up	on	the	couch.	Vanessa’s	in	a	corner	trying	to	paw	at	Nate,
who	couldn’t	look	less	interested	as	he	scans	the	room	behind	her.	If
Vanessa	were	a	guy,	somebody	would’ve	reported	her	by	now	for	all	the
unsolicited	groping	she	does.	My	eyes	briefly	meet	Nate’s,	and	we	both
look	away	without	acknowledging	each	other.

I	finally	find	Jake	on	the	patio	with	Luis,	who’s	headed	inside	for
more	 drinks.	 “Whaddya	 want?”	 Luis	 asks,	 clapping	 me	 on	 the
shoulder.

“Whatever	you’re	getting.”	I	take	a	seat	next	to	Jake,	who’s	listing
sideways	in	his	chair.

“Whassup,	killer?”	he	slurs,	and	sputters	out	a	laugh.	“Are	you
getting	tired	of	murder	jokes	yet?	’Cause	I’m	not.”

I’m	surprised	Jake	is	this	drunk;	he	usually	holds	back	during
football	season.	But	I	guess	his	week’s	been	almost	as	bad	as	mine.
That’s	what	I	came	to	talk	to	him	about,	although	as	I	watch	him	swat
hazily	at	a	bug,	I’m	not	sure	I	should	bother.

I	try	anyway.	“How’re	you	doing?	Been	a	lousy	few	days,	huh?”
Jake	laughs	again,	but	this	time	not	as	though	he	finds	anything
funny.	“That’s	so	 _Cooper_ 	of	you,	man.	Don’t	talk	about	your	shit	week,
just	check	in	on	mine.	You’re	a	goddamn	saint,	Coop.	You	really	are.”

The	edge	in	his	voice	warns	me	I	shouldn’t	take	the	bait,	but	I	do.
“You	mad	at	me	for	something,	Jake?”

“Why	would	I	be?	It’s	not	like	you’re	defending	my	whore	ex-
girlfriend	to	anybody	who’ll	listen.	Oh,	wait.	That’s	exactly	what	you’re
doing.”

Jake	 narrows	 his	 eyes	 at	 me,	 and	 I	 realize	 I	 can’t	 have	 the
conversation	I	came	to	have.	He’s	in	no	frame	of	mind	to	talk	about
easing	 up	 on	 Addy	 at	 school.	 “Jake,	 I	 know	 Addy’s	 in	 the	 wrong.
Everybody	knows	it.	She	made	a	stupid	mistake.”

“Cheating	isn’t	a	mistake.	It’s	a	choice,”	Jake	says	furiously,	and
for	a	second	he	sounds	stone-cold	sober.	He	drops	his	empty	beer
bottle	 on	 the	 ground	 and	 cocks	 his	 head	 with	 an	 accusing	 glare.


“Where	 the	 hell	 is	 Luis?	 Hey.”	 He	 grabs	 the	 arm	 of	 a	 passing
sophomore	and	plucks	an	unopened	beer	out	of	his	hand,	twisting	the
cap	off	and	taking	a	long	sip.	“What	was	I	saying?	Oh	yeah.	Cheating.
That’s	a	choice,	Coop.	You	know,	my	mom	cheated	on	my	dad	when	I
was	in	junior	high.	Screwed	up	our	whole	family.	Threw	a	grenade
right	in	the	middle	and—”	He	flings	an	arm,	spilling	half	his	beer,	and
makes	a	whoosh	sound.	“Everything	exploded.”

“I	didn’t	know	that.”	I’d	met	Jake	when	I	moved	to	Bayview	in
eighth	grade,	but	we	didn’t	start	hanging	out	till	high	school.	“Sorry,
man.	That	makes	it	even	worse,	huh?”

Jake	shakes	his	head,	eyes	glittering.	“Addy	has	no	clue	what	she’s
done.	Ruined	everything.”

“But	your	dad...forgave	your	mom,	right?	They’re	still	together?”
It’s	a	stupid	question.	I	was	at	his	house	a	month	ago	for	a	cookout
before	all	this	started.	His	dad	was	grilling	hamburgers	and	his	mom
was	talking	to	Addy	and	Keely	about	a	new	manicure	place	that	opened
in	Bayview	Center.	Like	normal.	Like	always.

“Yeah,	 they’re	 together.	 Nothing’s	 the	 same,	 though.	 It’s	 never
been	the	same.”	Jake’s	staring	in	front	of	him	with	such	disgust	that	I
don’t	know	what	to	say.	I	feel	like	a	jerk	for	telling	Addy	she	should
come,	and	I’m	glad	she	didn’t	listen	to	me.

Luis	returns	and	hands	us	both	a	beer.	“You	going	to	Simon’s
tomorrow?”	he	asks	Jake.

I	think	I	can’t	possibly	have	heard	Luis	right,	but	Jake	says,	“I
guess.”

Luis	catches	my	confused	look.	“His	mom	asked	a	bunch	of	us	to
come	over	and,	like,	take	something	to	remember	him	by	before	they
pack	his	stuff.	Creeps	me	out	since	I	barely	knew	the	guy,	but	she
seems	to	think	we	were	friends	so	what	can	you	say,	right?”	He	takes	a
sip	of	his	beer	and	cocks	an	eyebrow	at	me.	“Guess	you’re	not	invited?”

“Nope,”	I	say,	feeling	a	little	sick.	The	last	thing	I	want	to	do	is	pick
through	Simon’s	things	in	front	of	his	grieving	parents,	but	if	all	my
friends	are	going,	the	slight’s	pretty	clear.	I’m	under	suspicion,	and	not
welcome.

“Simon,	man.”	Jake	shakes	his	head	solemnly.	“He	was	freaking
brilliant.”	He	holds	his	beer	up	and	for	a	second	I	think	he’s	going	to


pour	it	onto	the	patio	in	a	homeboy	salute,	but	he	refrains	and	drinks	it
instead.

Olivia	 joins	 us,	 wrapping	 one	 arm	 around	 Luis’s	 waist.	 Guess
those	two	are	back	on	again.	She	pokes	me	with	her	free	hand	and
holds	up	her	phone,	her	face	bright	with	that	excited	look	she	gets
when	she’s	about	to	share	a	great	piece	of	gossip.	“Cooper,	did	you
know	you’re	in	the	 _Bayview	Blade_ ?”

The	way	she	says	it,	I’m	pretty	sure	they’re	not	covering	baseball.
This	night	keeps	getting	better.	“Had	no	idea.”

“Sunday	edition,	online	tonight.	All	about	Simon.	They’re	not...
accusing	you,	exactly,	but	the	four	of	you	are	named	as	persons	of
interest,	and	they	mention	that	stuff	Simon	was	gonna	post	about	you.
There’re	pictures	of	you	all.	And,	um,	it’s	been	shared	a	few	hundred
times	already.	So.”	Olivia	hands	me	her	phone.	“It’s	out	there	now,	I
guess.”


**Nate**

**Monday,	October	8,	2:50	p.m.**

I	hear	the	rumors	before	I	see	the	news	vans.	Three	of	them	parked	out
front	of	the	school	with	reporters	and	camera	crews	waiting	for	last
bell	to	ring.	They’re	not	allowed	on	school	property,	but	they’re	as	close
as	they	can	get.

Bayview	 High	 is	 _loving_ this.	 Chad	 Posner	 finds	 me	 after	 last
period	to	tell	me	people	are	practically	lining	up	to	be	interviewed
outside.	“They’re	asking	about	you,	man,”	he	warns.	“You	might	wanna
head	out	the	back.	They’re	not	allowed	in	the	parking	lot,	so	you	can
cut	through	the	woods	on	your	bike.”

“Thanks.”	I	take	off	and	scan	the	hallway	for	Bronwyn.	We	don’t
talk	 much	 at	 school	 to	 avoid—as	 she	 says	 in	 her	 lawyer	 voice— _the
appearance	of	collusion._ 	But	I’ll	bet	this	will	freak	her	out.	I	spot	her	at
her	locker	with	Maeve	and	one	of	her	friends,	and	sure	enough	she
looks	ready	to	throw	up.	When	she	sees	me	she	waves	me	closer,	not
even	trying	to	pretend	she	hardly	knows	me.

“Did	you	hear?”	she	asks,	and	I	nod.	“I	don’t	know	what	to	do.”	A
horrified	realization	crosses	her	face.	“I	guess	we	have	to	drive	past
them,	don’t	we?”

“I’ll	drive,”	Maeve	volunteers.	“You	can,	like,	hide	in	the	back	or
something.”

“Or	we	can	stay	here	till	they	leave,”	her	friend	suggests.	“Wait
them	out.”

“I	hate	this,”	Bronwyn	says.	Maybe	it’s	the	wrong	time	to	notice,
but	I	like	how	her	face	floods	with	color	whenever	she	feels	strongly
about	something.	It	makes	her	look	twice	as	alive	as	most	people,	and
more	distracting	than	she	already	does	in	a	short	dress	and	boots.

```
“Come	with	me,”	I	say.	“I’m	taking	my	bike	out	back	to	Boden
```

Street.	I’ll	bring	you	to	the	mall.	Maeve	can	pick	you	up	later.”

Bronwyn	brightens	as	Maeve	says,	“That’ll	work.	I’ll	come	find	you
in	half	an	hour	at	the	food	court.”

“Are	you	sure	that’s	a	good	idea?”	mutters	the	other	girl,	giving	me
a	hard	look.	“If	they	catch	you	together	it’ll	be	ten	times	worse.”

“They	won’t	catch	us,”	I	say	shortly.
I’m	not	positive	Bronwyn’s	on	board,	but	she	nods	and	tells	Maeve
she’ll	see	her	soon,	meeting	her	friend’s	annoyed	glance	with	a	calm
smile.	 I	 feel	 this	 stupid	 rush	 of	 triumph,	 like	 she	 chose	 me,	 even
though	she	basically	chose	not	winding	up	on	the	five	o’clock	news.	But
she	walks	close	to	me	as	we	head	out	the	back	door	to	the	parking	lot,
not	seeming	to	care	about	the	stares.	At	least	they’re	the	kind	we’ve
gotten	used	to.	No	microphones	or	cameras	involved.

I	hand	her	my	helmet	and	wait	for	her	to	settle	herself	on	my	bike
and	loop	her	arms	around	me.	Too	tight	again,	but	I	don’t	mind.	Her
death	 grip,	 along	 with	 how	 her	 legs	 look	 in	 that	 dress,	 is	 why	 I
engineered	this	escape	in	the	first	place.

We’re	not	in	the	woods	long	before	the	narrow	trail	I’m	taking
widens	into	a	dirt	path	that	runs	past	a	row	of	houses	behind	the
school.	I	take	back	roads	for	a	couple	of	miles	until	we	make	it	to	the
mall,	and	ease	my	bike	into	a	parking	spot	as	far	from	the	entrance	as	I
can	get.	Bronwyn	takes	the	helmet	off	and	hands	it	to	me,	squeezing
my	arm	as	she	does.	She	swings	her	legs	onto	the	pavement,	her	cheeks
flushed	and	her	hair	tousled.	“Thanks,	Nate.	That	was	nice	of	you.”

_I	didn’t	do	it	to	be	nice._ 	My	hand	reaches	out	and	catches	her
around	the	waist,	pulling	her	toward	me.	And	then	I	stop,	not	sure
what	to	do	next.	I’m	off	my	game.	If	anyone	had	asked	me	ten	minutes
ago,	I	would	have	said	I	don’t	have	game.	But	now	it	occurs	to	me	that
I	probably	do,	and	it’s	not	giving	a	shit.

When	I’m	still	sitting	and	she’s	standing	we’re	almost	the	same
height.	She’s	close	enough	for	me	to	notice	that	her	hair	smells	like
green	apples.	I	can’t	stop	looking	at	her	lips	while	I	wait	for	her	to	back
away.	She	doesn’t,	and	when	I	raise	my	eyes	to	hers	it	feels	like	the
breath	is	yanked	right	out	of	my	lungs.

Two	thoughts	run	through	my	head.	One,	I	want	to	kiss	her	more
than	I	want	air.	And	two,	if	I	do	I’m	bound	to	screw	everything	up	and


she’ll	stop	looking	at	me	that	way.

A	van	screeches	into	the	spot	next	to	us	and	we	both	jump,	bracing
for	the	Channel	7	News	camera	crew.	But	it’s	an	ordinary	soccer-mom
van	filled	with	screaming	kids.	When	they	tumble	out	Bronwyn	blinks
and	moves	off	to	the	side.	“Now	what?”	she	asks.

_Now	wait	till	they’re	gone	and	get	back	here._ 	But	she’s	already
walking	toward	the	entrance.	“Buy	me	a	giant	pretzel	for	saving	your
ass,”	I	say	instead.	She	laughs	and	I	wonder	if	she’s	thankful	for	the
interruption.

We	walk	past	the	potted	palms	that	frame	the	front	entrance,	and
I	pull	the	door	open	for	a	stressed-looking	mother	with	two	screaming
toddlers	in	a	double	stroller.	Bronwyn	flashes	her	a	sympathetic	smile
but	 as	 soon	 as	 we’re	 inside	 it	 disappears	 and	 she	 ducks	 her	 head.
“Everyone’s	 staring	 at	 me.	 You	 were	 smart	 not	 to	 have	 your	 class
picture	taken.	That	photo	in	the	 _Bayview	Blade_ 	didn’t	even	look	like
you.”

“Nobody’s	staring,”	I	tell	her,	but	it’s	not	true.	The	girl	folding
sweaters	at	Abercrombie	&	Fitch	widens	her	eyes	and	pulls	out	her
phone	when	we	pass	by.	“Even	if	they	were,	all	you’d	have	to	do	is	take
your	glasses	off.	Instant	disguise.”

I’m	kidding,	but	she	pulls	them	off	and	reaches	into	her	bag	for	a
bright-blue	case	she	snaps	them	into.	“Good	idea,	except	I’m	blind
without	them.”	I’ve	seen	Bronwyn	without	glasses	only	once	before,
when	they	got	knocked	off	by	a	volleyball	in	fifth-grade	gym	class.	It
was	 the	 first	 time	 I’d	 noticed	 her	 eyes	 weren’t	 blue	 like	 I	 always
thought,	but	a	clear,	bright	gray.

“I’ll	guide	you,”	I	tell	her.	“That’s	a	fountain.	Don’t	walk	into	it.”
Bronwyn	wants	to	go	to	the	Apple	store,	where	she	squints	at	iPod
Nanos	 for	 her	 sister.	 “Maeve’s	 starting	 to	 run	 now.	 She	 keeps
borrowing	mine	and	forgetting	to	charge	it.”

“You	 know	 that’s	 a	 rich-girl	 problem	 nobody	 else	 cares	 about,
right?”

She	 grins,	 unoffended.	 “I	 need	 to	 make	 a	 playlist	 to	 keep	 her
motivated.	Any	recommendations?”

```
“I	doubt	we	like	the	same	music.”
```

“Maeve	and	I	have	varied	musical	taste.	You’d	be	surprised.	Let
me	see	your	library.”	I	shrug	and	unlock	my	phone,	and	she	scrolls
through	iTunes	with	an	increasingly	furrowed	brow.	“What	 _is_ 	all	this?
Why	don’t	I	recognize	anything?”	Then	she	glances	at	me.	“You	have
‘Variations	on	the	Canon’?”

I	take	the	phone	from	her	and	put	it	back	in	my	pocket.	I	forgot	I’d
downloaded	that.	“I	like	your	version	better,”	I	say,	and	her	lips	curve
into	a	smile.

We	head	for	the	food	court,	making	small	talk	about	stupid	stuff
like	we’re	a	couple	of	ordinary	teenagers.	Bronwyn	insists	on	actually
buying	me	a	pretzel,	although	I	have	to	help	her	since	she	can’t	see	two
feet	in	front	of	her	face.	We	sit	by	the	fountain	to	wait	for	Maeve,	and
Bronwyn	 leans	 across	 the	 table	 so	 she	 can	 meet	 my	 eyes.	 “There’s
something	I’ve	been	meaning	to	talk	to	you	about.”	I	raise	my	brows,
interested,	until	she	says,	“I’m	worried	about	the	fact	that	you	don’t
have	a	lawyer.”

I	swallow	a	hunk	of	pretzel	and	avoid	her	eyes.	“Why?”
“Because	this	whole	thing’s	starting	to	implode.	My	lawyer	thinks
the	news	coverage	is	going	to	go	viral.	She	made	me	set	all	my	social
media	accounts	to	private	yesterday.	You	should	do	that	too,	by	the
way.	If	you	have	any.	I	couldn’t	find	you	anywhere.	Not	that	I	was
stalking	you.	Just	curious.”	She	gives	herself	a	little	shake,	like	she’s
trying	to	get	her	thoughts	back	on	track.	“Anyway.	The	pressure’s	on,
and	you’re	already	on	probation,	so	you...you	need	somebody	good	in
your	corner.”

_You’re	the	obvious	outlier	and	scapegoat._ 	That’s	what	she	means;
she’s	just	too	polite	to	say	it.	I	push	my	chair	away	from	the	table	and
tip	it	backward	on	two	legs.	“That’s	good	news	for	you,	right?	If	they
focus	on	me.”

“No!”	She’s	so	loud,	people	at	the	next	table	look	over,	and	she
lowers	her	voice.	“No,	it’s	awful.	But	I	was	thinking.	Have	you	heard	of
Until	Proven?”

“What?”
“Until	 Proven.	 It’s	 that	 pro	 bono	 legal	 group	 that	 started	 at
California	Western.	Remember,	they	got	that	homeless	guy	who	was
convicted	of	murder	released	because	of	mishandled	DNA	evidence
that	led	them	to	the	real	killer?”


I’m	not	sure	I’m	hearing	her	correctly.	“Are	you	comparing	me	to	a
homeless	guy	on	death	row?”

“That’s	only	one	example	of	a	high-profile	case.	They	do	other
stuff	too.	I	thought	it	might	be	worth	checking	them	out.”

She	and	Officer	Lopez	would	really	get	along.	They’re	both	positive
you	 can	 fix	 any	 problem	 with	 the	 right	 support	 group.	 “Sounds
pointless.”

“Would	you	mind	if	I	called	them?”
I	return	my	chair	to	the	floor	with	a	bang,	my	temper	rising.	“You
can’t	run	this	like	it’s	student	council,	Bronwyn.”

“And	you	can’t	just	wait	to	be	railroaded!”	She	puts	her	palms	flat
on	the	table	and	leans	forward,	eyes	blazing.

Jesus.	She’s	a	pain	in	my	ass	and	I	can’t	remember	why	I	wanted
to	kiss	her	so	badly	a	few	minutes	ago.	She’d	probably	turn	it	into	a
_project._ “Mind	 your	 own	 business.”	 It	 comes	 out	 harsher	 than	 I
intended,	 but	 I	 mean	 it.	 I’ve	 made	 it	 through	 most	 of	 high	 school
without	Bronwyn	Rojas	running	my	life,	and	I	don’t	need	her	to	start
now.

She	crosses	her	arms	and	glares	at	me.	“I’m	trying	to	 _help_ 	you.”
That’s	when	I	realize	Maeve	is	standing	there,	looking	back	and
forth	 between	 us	 like	 she’s	 watching	 the	 world’s	 least	 entertaining
ping-pong	game.	“Um.	Is	this	a	bad	time?”	she	says.

“It’s	a	 _great_ 	time,”	I	say.
Bronwyn	stands	abruptly,	putting	her	glasses	on	and	hiking	her
bag	over	her	shoulder.	“Thanks	for	the	ride.”	Her	voice	is	as	cold	as
mine.

Whatever.	 I	 get	 up	 and	 head	 for	 the	 exit	 without	 answering,
feeling	a	dangerous	combination	of	pissed	off	and	restless.	I	need	a
distraction	but	never	know	what	the	hell	to	do	with	myself	now	that
I’m	out	of	the	drug	business.	Maybe	stopping	was	just	delaying	the
inevitable.

I’m	almost	outside	when	someone	tugs	on	my	jacket.	When	I	turn,
arms	wrap	around	my	neck	and	the	clean,	bright	scent	of	green	apples
drifts	 around	 me	 as	 Bronwyn	 kisses	 my	 cheek.	 “You’re	 right,”	 she
whispers,	her	breath	warm	in	my	ear.	“I’m	sorry.	It’s	not	my	business.


Don’t	be	mad,	okay?	I	can’t	get	through	this	if	you	stop	talking	to	me.”

“I’m	not	mad.”	I	try	to	unfreeze	so	I	can	hug	her	back	instead	of
standing	there	like	a	block	of	wood,	but	she’s	already	gone,	hurrying
after	her	sister.

**Addy**

**Tuesday,	October	9,	8:45	a.m.**

Somehow	Bronwyn	and	Nate	managed	to	dodge	the	cameras.	Cooper
and	I	weren’t	as	lucky.	We	were	both	on	the	five	o’clock	news	on	all	the
major	 San	 Diego	 channels:	 Cooper	 behind	 the	 wheel	 of	 his	 Jeep
Wrangler,	 me	 climbing	 into	 Ashton’s	 car	 after	 I’d	 abandoned	 my
brand-new	bike	at	school	and	sent	her	a	panicked	text	begging	for	a
ride.	Channel	7	News	ended	up	with	a	pretty	clear	shot	of	me,	which
they	put	side	by	side	with	an	old	picture	of	eight-year-old	me	at	the
Little	 Miss	 Southeast	 San	 Diego	 pageant.	 Where,	 naturally,	 I	 was
second	runner-up.

At	least	there	aren’t	any	vans	when	Ashton	pulls	up	to	drop	me	off
at	school	the	next	day.	“Call	me	if	you	need	a	ride	again,”	she	says,	and
I	give	her	a	quick,	stranglehold	hug.	I	thought	I’d	be	more	comfortable
showing	 sisterly	 affection	 after	 last	 weekend’s	 cryfest,	 but	 it’s	 still
awkward	and	I	manage	to	snag	my	bracelet	on	her	sweater.	“Sorry,”	I
mutter,	and	she	gives	me	a	pained	grin.

“We’ll	get	better	at	that	eventually.”
I’ve	gotten	used	to	stares,	so	the	fact	that	they’ve	intensified	since
yesterday	doesn’t	faze	me.	When	I	leave	class	in	the	middle	of	history,
it’s	because	I	feel	my	period	coming	on	and	not	because	I	have	to	cry.

But	when	I	arrive	in	the	girls’	room,	someone	else	is.	Muffled
sounds	come	from	the	last	stall	before	whoever’s	there	gets	control	of
herself.	I	take	care	of	my	business—false	alarm—and	wash	my	hands,
staring	at	my	tired	eyes	and	surprisingly	bouncy	hair.	No	matter	how
awful	the	rest	of	my	life	is,	my	hair	still	manages	to	look	good.

I’m	about	to	leave,	but	hesitate	and	head	for	the	other	end	of	the
restroom.	I	lean	down	and	see	scuffed	black	combat	boots	under	the
last	stall	door.

“Janae?”
No	answer.	I	rap	my	knuckles	against	the	door.	“It’s	Addy.	Do	you
need	anything?”


“Jesus,	Addy,”	Janae	says	in	a	strangled	voice.	“ _No._ 	Go	away.”
“Okay,”	I	say,	but	I	don’t.	“You	know,	I’m	usually	the	one	in	that
stall	bawling	my	eyes	out.	So	I	have	a	lot	of	Kleenex	if	you	need	some.
Also	Visine.”	Janae	doesn’t	say	anything.	“I’m	sorry	about	Simon.	I
don’t	suppose	it	means	much	given	everything	you’ve	heard,	but...I	was
shocked	by	what	happened.	You	must	miss	him	a	lot.”

Janae	stays	silent,	and	I	wonder	if	I’ve	stuck	my	foot	in	my	mouth
again.	I’d	always	thought	Janae	was	in	love	with	Simon	and	he	was
oblivious.	Maybe	she’d	finally	told	him	the	truth	before	he	died,	and
got	rejected.	That	would	make	this	whole	thing	even	worse.

I’m	about	to	leave	when	Janae	heaves	a	deep	sigh.	The	door	opens,
revealing	her	blotchy	face	and	black-on-black	clothing.	“I’ll	take	that
Visine,”	she	says,	wiping	at	her	raccoon	eyes.

“You	should	take	the	Kleenex,	too,”	I	suggest,	pressing	both	into
her	hand.

She	 snorts	 out	 something	 like	 a	 laugh.	 “How	 the	 mighty	 have
fallen,	Addy.	You’ve	never	talked	to	me	before.”

“Did	 that	 bother	 you?”	 I	 ask,	 genuinely	 curious.	 Janae	 never
struck	me	as	someone	who	wanted	to	be	part	of	our	group.	Unlike
Simon,	who	was	always	prowling	around	the	edges,	looking	for	a	way
in.

Janae	wets	a	Kleenex	under	the	sink	and	dabs	at	her	eyes,	glaring
at	me	in	the	mirror	the	whole	time.	“Screw	you,	Addy.	Seriously.	What
kind	of	question	is	that?”

I’m	not	as	offended	as	I’d	normally	be.	“I	don’t	know.	A	stupid
one,	I	guess?	I’m	only	just	realizing	I	suck	at	social	cues.”

Janae	squirts	a	stream	of	Visine	into	both	eyes	and	her	raccoon
circles	reappear.	I	hand	her	another	Kleenex	so	she	can	repeat	the
wiping	process.	“Why?”

“Turns	out	Jake’s	the	one	who	was	popular,	not	me.	I	was	riding
coattails.”

Janae	takes	a	step	back	from	the	mirror.	“I	never	thought	I’d	hear
you	say	that.”

“ ‘I	am	large,	I	contain	multitudes,’ ”	I	tell	her,	and	her	eyes	widen.
“ _Song	 of	 Myself,_ right?	 Walt	 Whitman.	 I’ve	 been	 reading	 it	 since


Simon’s	funeral.	I	don’t	understand	most	of	it,	but	it’s	comforting	in	a
weird	way.”

Janae	keeps	dabbing	at	her	eyes.	“That’s	what	I	thought.	It	was
Simon’s	favorite	poem.”

I	think	about	Ashton	and	how	she’s	kept	me	sane	over	the	past
couple	 of	 weeks.	 And	 Cooper,	 who’s	 defended	 me	 at	 school	 even
though	there’s	no	real	friendship	between	us.	“Do	you	have	anybody	to
talk	to?”

“No,”	Janae	mutters,	and	her	eyes	fill	again.
I	know	from	experience	she	won’t	thank	me	for	continuing	the
conversation.	At	some	point	we	need	to	suck	it	up	and	get	to	class.
“Well,	if	you	want	to	talk	to	me—I	have	a	lot	of	time.	And	space	next	to
me	in	the	cafeteria.	So,	open	invitation	or	whatever.	Anyway,	I	really
am	sorry	about	Simon.	See	you.”

All	things	considered,	I	think	that	went	pretty	well.	She	stopped
insulting	me	toward	the	end,	anyway.

I	return	to	history	but	it’s	almost	over,	and	after	the	bell	rings	it’s
time	for	lunch—my	least	favorite	part	of	the	day.	I’ve	told	Cooper	to
stop	sitting	with	me,	because	I	can’t	stand	the	hard	time	everyone	else
gives	him,	but	I	hate	eating	alone.	I’m	about	to	skip	and	go	to	the
library	when	a	hand	plucks	at	my	sleeve.

“Hey.”	It’s	Bronwyn,	looking	surprisingly	fashionable	in	a	fitted
blazer	and	striped	flats.	Her	hair’s	down,	spilling	over	her	shoulders	in
glossy	dark	layers,	and	I	notice	with	a	stab	of	envy	how	clear	her	skin
is.	 No	 giant	 pimples	 for	 her,	 I’ll	 bet.	 I’m	 not	 sure	 I’ve	 ever	 seen
Bronwyn	looking	this	good,	and	I’m	so	distracted	that	I	almost	miss
her	next	words.	“Do	you	want	to	eat	lunch	with	us?”

“Ah...”	I	tilt	my	head	at	her.	I’ve	spent	more	time	with	Bronwyn	in
the	past	two	weeks	than	I	have	the	last	three	years	at	school,	but	it
hasn’t	exactly	been	social.	“Really?”

“Yeah.	Well.	We	have	some	stuff	in	common	now,	so...”	Bronwyn
trails	off,	her	eyes	flicking	away	from	mine,	and	I	wonder	if	she	ever
thinks	I	might	be	the	one	behind	all	this.	She	must,	because	I	think	it
about	her	sometimes.	But	in	an	evil-genius,	cartoon-villain	sort	of	way.
Now	that	she’s	standing	in	front	of	me	with	cute	shoes	and	a	tentative
smile,	it	seems	impossible.


“All	right,”	I	say,	and	follow	Bronwyn	to	a	table	with	her	sister,
Yumiko	 Mori,	 and	 some	 tall,	 sullen-looking	 girl	 I	 don’t	 know.	 It’s
better	than	skipping	lunch	at	the	library.

```
—
```
When	I	get	out	front	after	the	last	bell,	there’s	nothing—no	news	vans,
no	reporters—so	I	text	Ashton	that	she	doesn’t	have	to	pick	me	up,	and
take	the	opportunity	to	ride	my	bike	home.	I	stop	at	the	extralong	red
light	on	Hurley	Street,	resting	my	feet	on	the	pavement	as	I	look	at	the
stores	in	the	strip	mall	to	my	right:	cheap	clothes,	cheap	jewelry,	cheap
cellular.	And	cheap	haircuts.	Nothing	like	my	usual	salon	in	downtown
San	Diego,	which	charges	sixty	dollars	every	six	weeks	to	keep	split
ends	at	bay.

My	hair	feels	hot	and	heavy	under	my	helmet,	weighing	me	down.
Before	the	light	changes	I	angle	my	bike	off	the	road	and	over	the
sidewalk	into	the	mall	parking	lot.	I	lock	my	bike	on	the	rack	outside
Supercuts,	pull	off	my	helmet,	and	go	inside.

“Hi!”	The	girl	behind	the	register	is	only	a	few	years	older	than
me,	wearing	a	flimsy	black	tank	top	that	exposes	colorful	flower	tattoos
covering	her	arms	and	shoulders.	“Are	you	here	for	a	trim?”

“A	cut.”
“Okay.	We’re	not	super	busy,	so	I	can	take	you	right	now.”
She	directs	me	to	a	cheap	black	chair	that’s	losing	its	stuffing,	and
we	both	gaze	at	my	reflection	in	the	mirror	as	she	runs	her	hands
through	my	hair.	“This	is	so	pretty.”

I	stare	at	the	shining	locks	in	her	hands.	“It	needs	to	come	off.”
“A	couple	inches?”
I	shake	my	head.	“All	of	it.”
She	laughs	nervously.	“To	your	shoulders,	maybe?”
“All	of	it,”	I	repeat.
Her	eyes	widen	in	alarm.	“Oh,	you	don’t	mean	that.	Your	hair	is
beautiful!”	 She	 disappears	 from	 behind	 me	 and	 reappears	 with	 a
supervisor.	They	stand	there	conferring	for	a	few	minutes	in	hushed
tones.	Half	the	salon	is	staring	at	me.	I	wonder	how	many	of	them	saw
the	San	Diego	news	last	night,	and	how	many	think	I’m	just	an	overly
hormonal	teenage	girl.


“Sometimes	people	think	they	want	a	dramatic	cut,	but	they	don’t
really,”	the	supervisor	starts	cautiously.

I	don’t	let	her	finish.	I’m	beyond	tired	of	people	telling	me	what	I
want.	“Do	you	guys	do	haircuts	here?	Or	should	I	go	somewhere	else?”

She	tugs	at	a	lock	of	her	own	bleached-blond	hair.	“I’d	hate	for	you
to	regret	this.	If	you	want	a	different	look,	you	could	try—”

Shears	lie	across	the	counter	in	front	of	me,	and	I	reach	for	them.
Before	anyone	can	stop	me,	I	grab	a	thick	handful	of	hair	and	chop	the
whole	thing	off	above	my	ear.	Gasps	run	through	the	salon,	and	I	meet
the	tattooed	girl’s	shocked	eyes	in	the	mirror.

```
“Fix	it,”	I	tell	her.	So	she	does.
```

**Bronwyn**

**Friday,	October	12,	7:45	p.m.**

Four	 days	 after	 we’re	 featured	 on	 the	 local	 news,	 the	 story	 goes
national	on	 _Mikhail	Powers	Investigates._

I	knew	it	was	coming,	since	Mikhail’s	producers	had	tried	to	reach
my	 family	 all	 week.	 We	 never	 responded,	 thanks	 to	 basic	 common
sense	and	also	Robin’s	legal	advice.	Nate	didn’t	either,	and	Addy	said
she	and	Cooper	both	refused	to	talk	as	well.	So	the	show	will	be	airing
in	fifteen	minutes	without	commentary	from	any	of	the	people	actually
involved.

Unless	one	of	us	is	lying.	Which	is	always	a	possibility.
The	local	coverage	was	bad	enough.	Maybe	it	was	my	imagination,
but	I’m	pretty	sure	Dad	winced	every	time	I	was	referred	to	as	“the
daughter	of	prominent	Latino	business	leader	Javier	Rojas.”	And	he
left	 the	 room	 when	 one	 station	 reported	 his	 nationality	 as	 Chilean
instead	 of	 Colombian.	 The	 whole	 thing	 made	 me	 wish,	 for	 the
hundredth	 time	 since	 this	 started,	 that	 I’d	 just	 taken	 that	 D	 in
chemistry.

Maeve	and	I	are	sprawled	on	my	bed	watching	the	minutes	on	my
alarm	clock	tick	by	until	my	debut	as	a	national	disgrace.	Or	rather,	 _I_
am,	and	she’s	combing	through	the	4chan	links	she	found	through
Simon’s	admin	site.

“Check	this	out,”	she	says,	angling	her	laptop	toward	me.
The	 long	 discussion	 thread	 covers	 a	 school	 shooting	 that
happened	last	spring	a	few	counties	over.	A	sophomore	boy	concealed
a	handgun	in	his	jacket	and	opened	fire	in	the	hallway	after	the	first
bell.	Seven	students	and	a	teacher	died	before	the	boy	turned	the	gun
on	himself.	I	have	to	read	a	few	of	the	comments	more	than	once
before	I	realize	the	thread	isn’t	condemning	the	boy,	but	celebrating


him.	It’s	a	bunch	of	sickos	cheering	on	what	he	did.

“Maeve.”	I	burrow	my	head	in	my	arms,	not	wanting	to	read	any
more.	“What	the	hell	is	this?”

“Some	forum	Simon	was	all	over	a	few	months	back.”
I	raise	my	head	to	stare	at	her.	“ _Simon_ 	posted	there?	How	do	you
know?”

“He	used	that	AnarchiSK	name	from	About	That,”	Maeve	replies.
I	scan	the	thread,	but	it’s	too	long	to	pick	out	individual	names.
“Are	you	sure	it’s	Simon?	Maybe	other	people	use	the	same	name.”

“I’ve	been	spot-checking	posts,	and	it’s	definitely	Simon,”	she	says.
“He	references	places	in	Bayview,	talks	about	clubs	he	was	in	at	school,
mentions	his	car	a	few	times.”	Simon	drove	a	1970s	Volkswagen	Bug
that	he	was	freakishly	proud	of.	Maeve	leans	against	the	cushions,
chewing	on	her	bottom	lip.	“There’s	a	lot	to	go	through,	but	I’m	going
to	read	the	whole	thing	when	I	have	time.”

I	can’t	think	of	anything	I’d	like	to	do	less.	“Why?”
“The	thread’s	full	of	weird	people	with	axes	to	grind,”	Maeve	says.
“Simon	 might’ve	 made	 some	 enemies	 there.	 Worth	 looking	 into,
anyway.”	She	takes	her	laptop	back	and	adds,	“I	got	that	encrypted	file
of	Cooper’s	at	the	library	the	other	day,	but	I	can’t	get	it	open.	 _Yet._ ”

“Girls.”	My	mother’s	voice	is	strained	as	she	calls	upstairs.	“It’s
time.”

That’s	 right.	 My	 entire	 family	 is	 watching	 _Mikhail	 Powers
Investigates_ together.	 Which	 is	 a	 circle	 of	 hell	 even	 Dante	 never
imagined.

Maeve	shuts	her	laptop	as	I	heave	myself	to	my	feet.	There’s	a
slight	buzzing	from	inside	my	end	table,	and	I	open	the	drawer	to	pull
out	my	Nate	phone.	 _Enjoy	the	show,_ 	his	text	says.

_Not	funny,_ 	I	reply.
“Put	that	away,”	Maeve	says	with	mock	severity.	“Now	is	 _not	the
time._ ”

We	head	downstairs	to	the	living	room,	where	Mom	has	already
settled	into	an	armchair	with	an	exceptionally	full	glass	of	wine.	Dad’s
in	full	Evening	Executive	mode,	wearing	his	favorite	casual	fleece	vest


and	surrounded	by	a	half-dozen	communication	devices.	A	commercial
for	paper	towels	flashes	across	the	television	screen	as	Maeve	and	I	sit
side	by	side	on	the	couch	and	wait	for	 _Mikhail	Powers	Investigates_ 	to
start.

The	show	focuses	on	true	crime	and	it’s	pretty	sensationalistic,	but
more	 credible	 than	 similar	 shows	 because	 of	 Mikhail’s	 hard-news
background.	 He	 spent	 years	 as	 an	 anchor	 with	 one	 of	 the	 major
networks,	and	brings	a	certain	gravitas	to	the	proceedings.

He	 always	 reads	 the	 beginning	 hook	 in	 his	 deep,	 authoritative
voice	while	grainy	police	photos	play	across	the	screen.

_A	young	mother	disappears.	A	double	life	exposed.	And	one	year
later,	a	shocking	arrest.	Has	justice	finally	been	served?_

_A	 high-profile	 couple	 dead.	 A	 dedicated	 daughter	 suspected.
Could	her	Facebook	account	hold	the	key	to	the	killer’s	identity?_

I	 know	 the	 formula,	 so	 it	 shouldn’t	 be	 any	 surprise	 when	 it’s
applied	to	me.

_A	high	school	student’s	mysterious	death.	Four	classmates	with
secrets	to	hide.	When	the	police	keep	running	into	dead	ends,	what’s
next?_

Dread	starts	spreading	through	me:	my	stomach	aches,	my	lungs
compress,	even	my	mouth	has	a	horrible	taste.	For	almost	two	weeks
I’ve	been	questioned	and	scrutinized,	whispered	about	and	judged.	I’ve
had	 to	 deflect	 questions	 about	 Simon’s	 allegations	 with	 police	 and
teachers,	and	watch	their	eyes	harden	as	they	read	between	the	lines.
I’ve	waited	for	another	shoe	to	drop;	for	the	Tumblr	to	release	a	video
of	me	accessing	Mr.	Camino’s	files,	or	for	the	police	to	file	charges.	But
nothing’s	felt	quite	so	raw	and	real	as	watching	my	class	picture	appear
over	Mikhail	Powers’s	shoulder	on	national	television.

There’s	footage	of	Mikhail	and	his	team	in	Bayview,	but	he	does
most	 of	 his	 reporting	 from	 behind	 a	 sleek	 chrome	 desk	 in	 his	 Los
Angeles	studio.	He	has	smooth	dark	skin	and	hair,	expressive	eyes,	and
the	most	perfectly	fitted	wardrobe	I’ve	ever	seen.	I	have	no	doubt	that
if	he’d	managed	to	catch	me	alone,	I’d	have	spilled	all	sorts	of	things	I
shouldn’t.

“But	who	 _are_ 	the	Bayview	Four?”	Mikhail	asks,	staring	intently
into	the	camera.


“You	guys	have	a	name,”	Maeve	whispers,	but	not	quietly	enough
that	Mom	doesn’t	hear.

“Maeve,	there	is	 _nothing_ 	funny	about	this,”	she	says	tightly	as	the
camera	cuts	to	video	of	my	parents’	offices.

Oh	no.	They’re	starting	with	me.
_Honor	 student	 Bronwyn	 Rojas	 comes	 from	 a	 high-achieving
family	traumatized	by	their	youngest	child’s	lingering	illness.	Did	the
pressure	to	measure	up	compel	her	to	cheat	and	take	Yale	out	of	her
reach	forever?_ 	Followed	by	a	spokesperson	from	Yale	confirming	that
I	have	not,	in	fact,	applied	yet.

We	all	get	our	turn.	Mikhail	examines	Addy’s	beauty	pageant	past,
speaks	 with	 baseball	 analysts	 about	 the	 prevalence	 of	 high	 school
juicing	and	its	potential	impact	on	Cooper’s	career,	and	digs	through
the	particulars	of	Nate’s	drug	bust	and	probation	sentence.

“It’s	not	fair,”	Maeve	breathes	into	my	ear.	“They’re	not	saying
anything	about	how	his	dad’s	a	drunk	and	his	mom’s	dead.	Where’s	the
context?”

“He	wouldn’t	want	that,	anyway,”	I	whisper	back.
I	cringe	my	way	through	the	show	until	an	interview	with	a	lawyer
from	Until	Proven.	Since	none	of	our	lawyers	agreed	to	talk,	Mikhail’s
team	tapped	Until	Proven	as	subject-matter	experts.	The	lawyer	they
speak	with,	Eli	Kleinfelter,	doesn’t	look	even	ten	years	older	than	me.
He	has	wild	curly	hair,	a	sparse	goatee,	and	intense	dark	eyes.

“Here’s	what	I’d	say,	if	I	were	their	lawyer,”	he	says,	and	I	lean
forward	despite	myself.	“All	the	attention’s	on	these	four	kids.	They’re
getting	dragged	through	the	mud	with	no	evidence	tying	them	to	any
crime	after	weeks	of	investigation.	But	there	was	a	fifth	kid	in	the
room,	wasn’t	there?	And	he	seems	like	the	type	who	might’ve	had	more
than	 four	 enemies.	 So	 you	 tell	 me.	 Who	 _else_ had	 a	 motive?	 What
story’s	 _not_ 	being	told?	That’s	where	I’d	be	looking.”

“Exactly,”	Maeve	says,	drawing	out	each	syllable.
“And	you	can’t	assume	Simon	was	the	only	person	with	access	to
the	About	That	admin	panel,”	Eli	continues.	“Anybody	could’ve	gotten
into	that	before	he	died	and	either	viewed	or	changed	those	posts.”

```
I	look	at	Maeve,	but	this	time	she	doesn’t	say	anything.	Just	stares
```

at	the	screen	with	a	half	smile	on	her	face.

I	can’t	stop	thinking	about	Eli’s	words	for	the	rest	of	the	night.
Even	when	I’m	on	the	phone	with	Nate,	half	watching	 _Battle	Royale,_
which	is	better	than	a	lot	of	the	movies	Nate	likes.	But	between	 _Mikhail
Powers	Investigates_ 	and	our	trip	to	the	mall	on	Monday—which	I’ve
been	thinking	about	nonstop	in	those	spare	moments	when	I’m	not
thinking	 about	 going	 to	 jail—I	 can’t	 concentrate.	 Too	 many	 other
thoughts	compete	for	brain	space.

_Nate	was	about	to	kiss	me,	wasn’t	he?	And	I	wanted	him	to.	So
why	didn’t	we?_

_Eli	finally	said	it.	Why	isn’t	anyone	looking	at	other	suspects?
I	wonder	if	Nate	and	I	are	officially	friend-zoned	now.
Mikhail	Powers	does	serial	investigations,	so	this	will	only	get
worse._

_Nate	and	I	would	be	horrible	together	anyway.	Probably.
Did_ 	People	 _magazine	seriously	just	email	me?_
“What’s	 going	 on	 in	 that	 big	 brain	 of	 yours,	 Bronwyn?”	 Nate
finally	asks.

Too	much,	and	most	of	it	I	probably	shouldn’t	share.	“I	want	to
talk	to	Eli	Kleinfelter,”	I	say.	“Not	about	you,”	I	add	when	Nate	doesn’t
reply.	“Just	in	general.	I’m	intrigued	by	how	he	thinks.”

“You	already	have	a	lawyer.	Think	she’d	want	you	getting	a	second
opinion?”

I	know	she	wouldn’t.	Robin	is	all	about	containment	and	defense.
_Don’t	give	anybody	anything	they	can	use	against	you._ 	“I	don’t	want
him	to	represent	me	or	anything.	I	just	want	a	conversation.	Maybe	I’ll
try	to	call	him	next	week.”

“You	never	shut	off,	do	you?”
It	doesn’t	sound	like	a	compliment.	“No,”	I	admit,	wondering	if
I’ve	killed	whatever	weird	attraction	Nate	might’ve	once	felt	toward
me.

Nate’s	silent	as	we	watch	Shogo	fake	Shuya’s	and	Noriko’s	deaths.
“This	isn’t	bad,”	he	finally	says.	“But	you	still	owe	me	finishing	 _Ringu_
in	person.”


Tiny	electrical	sparks	zip	through	my	bloodstream.	 _Attraction	not
dead,	 then?	 Maybe	 on	 life	 support._ “I	 know.	 That’s	 logistically
challenging,	though.	Especially	now	that	we’re	notorious.”

“There	aren’t	any	news	vans	here	now.”
I’ve	thought	about	this.	Maybe	a	few	dozen	times	since	he	first
asked	me.	And	while	I	don’t	understand	much	about	what’s	going	on
between	Nate	and	me,	I	do	know	this:	whatever	happens	next	won’t
involve	me	driving	to	his	house	in	the	middle	of	the	night.	I	start	to	tell
him	 all	 my	 excellent	 practical	 reasons,	 like	 how	 the	 Volvo’s	 noisy
engine	will	wake	my	parents,	when	he	says,	“I	could	come	get	you.”

I	blow	out	a	sigh	and	stare	at	the	ceiling.	I’m	no	good	at	navigating
these	situations,	probably	because	they’ve	only	ever	happened	in	my
head.	“I	feel	weird	going	to	your	house	at	one	in	the	morning,	Nate.
Like,	it’s...different	from	watching	a	movie.	And	I	don’t	know	you	well
enough	to,	um,	not	watch	a	movie	with	you.”	Oh	God.	This	is	why
people	shouldn’t	wait	until	their	senior	year	of	high	school	to	date.	My
whole	face	burns,	and	as	I	wait	for	him	to	answer,	I’m	deeply	thankful
he	can’t	see	me.

“Bronwyn.”	Nate’s	voice	isn’t	as	mocking	as	I’d	expected.	“I’m	not
trying	to	 _not-watch_ 	a	movie	with	you.	I	mean,	sure,	if	you	were	into
that,	I	wouldn’t	say	no.	Believe	me.	But	the	main	reason	I	invited	you
over	after	midnight	is	that	my	house	sucks	during	the	day.	For	one
thing,	you	can	see	it.	Which	I	don’t	recommend.	For	another,	my	dad’s
around.	I’d	rather	you	not...you	know.	Trip	over	him.”

My	heart	keeps	missing	beats.	“I	don’t	care	about	that.”
“I	do.”
“Okay.”	 I	 don’t	 fully	 understand	 Nate’s	 rules	 for	 managing	 his
world,	but	for	once	I’m	going	to	mind	my	own	business	and	not	give
my	 opinion	 about	 what	 does	 and	 doesn’t	 matter.	 “We’ll	 figure
something	else	out.”

**Cooper**

**Saturday,	October	13,	4:35	p.m.**

There’s	no	good	place	to	break	up	with	someone,	but	at	least	their
living	room	is	private	and	they	don’t	have	to	go	anywhere	afterward.	So
that’s	where	I	give	Keely	the	news.

```
It’s	not	because	of	what	Nonny	said.	It’s	been	coming	for	a	while.
```

Keely’s	great	in	a	dozen	different	ways	but	not	for	me,	and	I	can’t	drag
her	through	all	this	knowing	that.

Keely	wants	an	explanation,	and	I	don’t	have	a	good	one.	“If	it’s
because	 of	 the	 investigation,	 I	 don’t	 care!”	 she	 says	 tearfully.	 “I’m
behind	you	no	matter	what.”

“It’s	not	that,”	I	tell	her.	It’s	not	 _only_ 	that,	anyway.
“And	I	don’t	believe	a	word	of	that	awful	Tumblr.”
“I	know,	Keely.	I	appreciate	that,	I	really	do.”	There	was	another
post	this	morning,	crowing	about	the	media	coverage:

```
The 	Mikhail	Powers	Investigates 	site	has	thousands	of	comments	about	the
Bayview	Four.	(Kind	of	a	dull	name,	by	the	way.	Would’ve	expected	better	from
a	top-ranked	newsmagazine.)	Some	call	for	jail	time.	Some	rail	about	how
spoiled	and	entitled	kids	are	today,	and	how	this	is	another	example	of	that.
It’s	a	great	story:	four	good-looking,	high-profile	students	all	being
investigated	for	murder.	And	nobody’s	what	they	seem.
The	pressure’s	on	now,	Bayview	Police.	Maybe	you	should	be	looking	a
little	closer	at	Simon’s	old	entries.	You	might	find	some	interesting	hints	about
the	Bayview	Four.
Just	saying.
```
That	last	part	made	my	blood	run	cold.	Simon	had	never	written
about	me	before,	but	I	don’t	like	the	implication.	Or	the	sick,	heavy
feeling	that	something	else	is	coming.	And	soon.

“Then	why	are	you	doing	this?”	Keely	has	her	head	in	her	hands,
tears	 running	 down	 her	 face.	 She’s	 a	 pretty	 crier;	 nothing	 red	 or
splotchy	about	her.	She	peers	at	me	with	swimming	dark	eyes.	“Did
Vanessa	say	something?”

“Did—what?	Vanessa?	What	would	 _she_ 	say?”
“She’s	being	a	bitch	about	me	still	talking	to	Addy	and	she	was
going	to	tell	you	something	you	shouldn’t	even	care	about,	because	it
happened	before	we	were	dating.”	She	looks	at	me	expectantly,	and	my
blank	expression	seems	to	make	her	mad.	“Or	maybe	you	 _should_ 	care,
so	you’d	care	about	 _something_ 	related	to	me.	You’re	so	holier-than-
thou	about	how	Jake	is	acting,	Cooper,	but	at	least	he	has	emotions.
He’s	not	a	robot.	It’s	normal	to	be	jealous	when	the	girl	you	care	about
is	with	someone	else.”

```
“I	know.”
```

Keely	waits	a	beat	before	giving	a	sarcastic	little	laugh.	“That’s	it,
huh?	You’re	not	even	a	little	bit	curious.	You’re	not	worried	about	me,
or	protective	of	me.	You	just	don’t	give	a	shit.”

We’re	at	the	point	where	nothing	I	say	will	be	right.	“I’m	sorry,
Keely.”

“I	hooked	up	with	Nate,”	she	says	abruptly,	eyes	locked	on	mine.
And	I	have	to	admit,	that	surprises	me.	“At	Luis’s	party	the	last	night	of
junior	year.	Simon	was	following	me	around	all	night	and	I	was	sick	of
it.	Nate	showed	up	and	I	figured,	what	the	hell.	He’s	hot,	right?	Even	if
he	 _is_ 	a	total	degenerate.”	She	smirks	at	me,	a	trace	of	bitterness	in	her
face.	“We	just	kissed,	mostly.	That	night.	Then	you	asked	me	out	a	few
weeks	later.”	She	gives	me	that	intense	look	again,	and	I’m	not	sure
what	she’s	trying	to	get	across.

“So	you	were	with	me	and	Nate	at	the	same	time?”
“Would	that	bother	you?”
She	wants	something	from	me	out	of	this	conversation.	I	wish	I
could	figure	it	out	and	let	her	have	it,	because	I	know	I	haven’t	been
fair	to	her.	Her	dark	eyes	are	fastened	on	mine,	her	cheeks	flushed,	her
lips	slightly	parted.	She	really	is	beautiful,	and	if	I	told	her	I’d	made	a
mistake,	she’d	take	me	back	and	I’d	keep	being	the	most	envied	guy	at
Bayview.	“I	guess	I	wouldn’t	like	it—”	I	start,	but	she	interrupts	me
with	a	half	laugh,	half	sob.

“Oh	my	God,	Cooper.	Your	 _face._ 	You	seriously	could	not	care	less.
Well,	for	the	record,	I	stopped	doing	anything	with	Nate	as	soon	as	you
asked	me	out.”	She’s	crying	again,	and	I	feel	like	the	world’s	biggest
jerk.	“You	know,	Simon	would’ve	given	anything	if	I’d	chosen	him.	You
didn’t	even	know	it	 _was_ 	a	choice.	People	always	pick	you,	don’t	they?
They	always	picked	me,	too.	Until	you	came	along	and	made	me	feel
invisible.”

“Keely,	I	never	meant—”
She’s	not	listening	to	me	anymore.	“You’ve	never	cared,	have	you?
You	just	wanted	the	right	accessory	for	scouting	season.”

```
“That’s	not	fair—”
“It’s	all	a	big	lie,	isn’t	it,	Cooper?	Me,	your	fastball—”
“I’ve	 never 	used	steroids,”	I	interrupt,	suddenly	angry.
```

Keely	 gives	 another	 strangled	 laugh.	 “Well,	 at	 least	 you’re
passionate	about	 _something._ ”

“I’m	gonna	go.”	I	stand	abruptly,	adrenaline	coursing	through	me
as	I	stalk	out	her	door	before	I	say	something	I	shouldn’t.	I	got	tested
after	Simon’s	accusations	came	to	light,	and	I	was	clean.	And	I	was
tested	once	over	the	summer	as	part	of	an	extensive	physical	the	UCSD
sports	 medicine	 center	 did	 before	 putting	 together	 my	 training
regimen.	But	that’s	it,	and	since	plenty	of	steroids	disappear	from	your
system	within	weeks,	I	can’t	escape	the	taint	entirely.	I’ve	told	Coach
Ruffalo	there’s	no	truth	to	the	accusations,	and	so	far	he’s	sitting	tight
on	contacting	any	colleges.	We’re	part	of	the	news	cycle	now,	though,
so	things	won’t	stay	quiet	for	long.

And	Keely’s	right—I’ve	been	a	lot	more	worried	about	that	than
about	our	relationship.	I	owe	her	a	better	apology	than	the	one	I	just
half-assed.	But	I	don’t	know	how	to	give	it.


**Addy**

**Monday,	October	15,	12:15	p.m.**

Sexism	is	alive	and	well	in	true-crime	coverage,	because	Bronwyn	and	I
aren’t	nearly	as	popular	with	the	general	public	as	Cooper	and	Nate.
_Especially_ 	Nate.	All	the	tween	girls	posting	about	us	on	social	media
love	him.	They	couldn’t	care	less	that	he’s	a	convicted	drug	dealer,
because	he’s	got	dreamy	eyes.

Same	goes	for	school.	Bronwyn	and	I	are	pariahs—other	than	her
friends,	her	sister,	and	Janae,	hardly	anyone	talks	to	us.	They	just
whisper	behind	our	backs.	But	Cooper’s	as	golden	as	ever.	And	Nate—
well,	it’s	not	like	Nate	was	ever	popular,	exactly.	He’s	never	seemed	to
care	what	people	think,	though,	and	he	still	doesn’t.

“Seriously,	Addy,	stop	pulling	that	stuff	up.	I	don’t	want	to	see	it.”
Bronwyn	rolls	her	eyes	at	me,	but	she	doesn’t	really	look	mad.	I
guess	we’re	almost	friends	now,	or	as	friendly	as	you	can	get	when
you’re	not	one	hundred	percent	sure	the	other	person	isn’t	framing	you
for	murder.

She	won’t	play	along	with	my	obsessive	need	to	track	our	news
stories,	though.	And	I	don’t	show	her	everything,	especially	not	the
horrible	commenters	tossing	racial	slurs	at	her	family.	That’s	an	extra
layer	of	suck	she	doesn’t	need.	Instead,	I	show	Janae	one	of	the	more
positive	 articles	 I’ve	 found.	 “Look.	 The	 most-shared	 article	 on
_BuzzFeed_ 	is	Cooper	leaving	the	gym.”

Janae	looks	awful.	She’s	lost	more	weight	since	I	first	ran	into	her
in	the	bathroom,	and	she’s	jumpier	than	ever.	I’m	not	sure	why	she
eats	lunch	with	us,	since	most	of	the	time	she	doesn’t	say	a	word.	But
she	glances	gamely	at	my	phone.	“It’s	a	good	picture	of	him,	I	guess.”

Kate	shoots	me	a	severe	look.	“Would	you	put	that	away?”	I	do,
but	in	my	head	I’m	giving	her	the	finger	the	whole	time.	Yumiko’s	all


right,	but	Kate	almost	makes	me	miss	Vanessa.

No.	That’s	a	complete	and	utter	lie.	I	 _hate_ 	Vanessa.	Hate	how	she’s
mean-girled	her	way	into	the	center	of	my	former	group	and	how	she’s
glommed	on	to	Jake	like	they’re	a	couple.	Even	though	I	don’t	see
much	interest	on	his	part.	Chopping	my	hair	off	was	like	giving	up	on
Jake,	since	he	wouldn’t	have	noticed	me	three	years	ago	without	it.	But
just	because	I’ve	abandoned	hope	doesn’t	mean	I’ve	stopped	paying
attention.

After	lunch	I	head	for	earth	science,	settling	myself	on	a	bench
next	to	a	lab	partner	who	barely	glances	in	my	direction.	“Don’t	get	too
comfortable,”	Ms.	Mara	warns.	“We’re	mixing	things	up	today.	You’ve
all	been	with	your	partners	for	a	while,	so	let’s	rotate.”	She	gives	us
complicated	directions—some	people	move	left,	others	right,	and	the
rest	of	us	stay	still—and	I	don’t	pay	much	attention	to	the	process	until
I	wind	up	next	to	TJ.

His	nose	looks	a	lot	better,	but	I	doubt	it’ll	ever	be	straight	again.
He	gives	me	a	sheepish	half	smile	as	he	pulls	the	tray	of	rocks	in	front
of	us	closer.	“Sorry.	This	is	probably	your	worst	nightmare,	right?”

_Don’t	 flatter	 yourself,	 TJ,_ I	 think.	 He’s	 got	 nothing	 on	 my
nightmares.	All	those	months	of	angsty	guilt	about	sleeping	with	him
in	his	beach	house	seem	like	they	happened	in	another	lifetime.	“It’s
fine.”

We	classify	rocks	in	silence	until	TJ	says,	“I	like	your	hair.”
I	snort.	“Yeah,	right.”	With	the	possible	exception	of	Ashton,	who’s
biased,	 _nobody_ likes	 my	 hair.	 My	 mother	 is	 appalled.	 My	 former
friends	laughed	openly	when	they	saw	me	the	next	day.	Even	Keely
smirked.	She’s	moved	right	on	to	Luis,	like	if	she	can’t	have	Cooper,
she’ll	settle	for	his	catcher	instead.	Luis	dumped	Olivia	for	her,	but
nobody	blinked	an	eye	about	 _that._

“I’m	serious.	You	can	finally	see	your	face.	You	look	like	a	blond
Emma	Watson.”

That’s	false.	But	nice	of	him	to	say,	I	guess.	I	hold	a	rock	between
my	thumb	and	forefinger	and	squint	at	it.	“What	do	you	think?	Igneous
or	sedimentary?”

```
TJ	shrugs.	“I	can’t	tell	the	difference.”
I	take	a	guess	and	sort	the	rock	into	the	igneous	pile.	“TJ,	if	I	can
```

manage	to	care	about	rocks,	I’m	pretty	sure	you	can	put	in	more	of	an
effort.”

He	blinks	at	me	in	surprise,	then	grins.	“ _There_ 	you	are.”
“What?”
Everyone	seems	absorbed	in	their	rocks,	but	he	lowers	his	voice
anyway.	“You	were	really	funny	when	we—um,	that	first	time	we	hung
out.	On	the	beach.	But	whenever	I	saw	you	after	that	you	were	so...
passive.	Always	agreeing	with	whatever	Jake	said.”

I	glower	at	the	tray	in	front	of	me.	“That’s	a	rude	thing	to	say.”
TJ’s	voice	is	mild.	“Sorry.	But	I	could	never	figure	out	why	you’d
fade	into	the	background	that	way.	You	were	a	lot	of	fun.”	He	catches
my	glare	and	adds	hastily,	“Not	like	 _that._ 	Or,	well,	yes,	like	that,	but
also...You	know	what?	Never	mind.	I’ll	stop	talking	now.”

“Great	 idea,”	 I	 mutter,	 scooping	 up	 a	 handful	 of	 rocks	 and
dumping	them	in	front	of	him.	“Sort	these,	would	you?”

It’s	not	that	TJ’s	“fade	into	the	background”	comment	stings.	I
know	it’s	true.	I	can’t	wrap	my	head	around	the	rest,	though.	Nobody’s
ever	said	I’m	funny	before.	Or	fun.	I	always	figured	TJ	was	still	talking
to	 me	 because	 he	 wouldn’t	 mind	 getting	 me	 alone	 again.	 I	 never
thought	 he	 might’ve	 actually	 enjoyed	 hanging	 out	 during	 the
nonphysical	part	of	the	day.

We	finish	the	rest	of	the	class	in	silence	except	to	agree	or	disagree
on	rock	classification,	and	when	the	bell	rings	I	grab	my	backpack	and
head	for	the	hall	without	a	backward	look.

Until	the	voice	behind	me	stops	me	like	I’ve	slammed	into	an
invisible	wall.	“Addy.”

My	shoulders	tense	as	I	turn.	I	haven’t	tried	talking	to	Jake	since
he	blew	me	off	at	his	locker,	and	I’m	afraid	of	what	he’s	going	to	say	to
me	now.

“How’ve	you	been?”	he	asks.
I	almost	laugh.	“Oh,	you	know.	 _Not	good._ ”
I	can’t	read	Jake’s	expression.	He	doesn’t	look	mad,	but	he’s	not
smiling	either.	He	seems	different	somehow.	Older?	Not	exactly,	but...
less	boyish,	maybe.	He’s	been	staring	right	through	me	for	almost	two
weeks,	and	I	don’t	understand	why	I’m	suddenly	visible	again.	“Things


must	be	getting	intense,”	he	says.	“Cooper’s	totally	clammed	up.	Do
you—”	He	hesitates,	shifting	his	backpack	from	one	shoulder	to	the
other.	“Do	you	want	to	talk	sometime?”

My	throat	feels	like	I	swallowed	something	sharp.	 _Do	I?_ 	Jake	waits
for	an	answer,	and	I	mentally	shake	myself.	Of	course	I	do.	That’s	all
I’ve	wanted	since	this	happened.	“Yes.”

“Okay.	Maybe	this	afternoon?	I’ll	text	you.”	He	holds	my	gaze,	still
not	smiling,	and	adds,	“God,	I	can’t	get	used	to	your	hair.	You	don’t
even	look	like	yourself.”

I’m	about	to	say	 _I	know_ 	when	I	remember	TJ’s	words.	 _You	were
so...passive.	Always	agreeing	with	whatever	Jake	said._ 	“Well,	I	am,”	I
say	instead,	and	take	off	down	the	hall	before	he	can	break	eye	contact
first.

**Nate**

**Monday,	October	15,	3:15	p.m.**

Bronwyn	settles	herself	on	the	rock	next	to	me,	smoothing	her	skirt
over	her	knees	and	looking	over	the	treetops	in	front	of	us.	“I’ve	never
been	to	Marshall’s	Peak	before,”	she	says.

I’m	not	surprised.	Marshall’s	Peak—which	isn’t	really	a	peak,	more
of	a	rocky	outcropping	overlooking	the	woods	we	cut	through	on	our
way	 out	 of	 school—is	 Bayview’s	 so-called	 scenic	 area.	 It’s	 also	 a
popular	spot	for	drinking,	drugs,	and	hookups,	although	not	at	three
o’clock	on	a	Monday	afternoon.	I’m	pretty	sure	Bronwyn	has	no	clue
what	happens	here	on	weekends.	“Hope	reality	lives	up	to	the	hype,”	I
say.

She	smiles.	“It	beats	getting	ambushed	by	Mikhail	Powers’s	crew.”
We	had	another	sneak-out-the-back	routine	when	they	showed	up	at
the	 front	 of	 school	 today.	 I’m	 surprised	 they	 haven’t	 wised	 up	 to
staking	out	the	woods	yet.	Driving	to	the	mall	again	seemed	like	a	bad
idea	given	how	high	our	profile’s	risen	over	the	past	week,	so	here	we
are.

Bronwyn’s	 eyes	 are	 down,	 watching	 a	 line	 of	 ants	 carry	 a	 leaf
across	the	rock	next	to	us.	She	licks	her	lips	like	she’s	nervous,	and	I
shift	a	little	closer.	Most	of	my	time	with	her	is	spent	on	the	phone,	and
I	can’t	tell	what	she’s	thinking	in	person.

```
“I	called	Eli	Kleinfelter,”	she	says.	“From	Until	Proven.”
```

Oh.	 _That’s_ 	what	she’s	thinking.	I	shift	back.	“Okay.”
“It	was	an	interesting	conversation,”	she	says.	“He	was	nice	about
hearing	 from	 me,	 didn’t	 seem	 surprised	 at	 all.	 He	 promised	 he
wouldn’t	tell	anybody	I’d	called	him.”

For	all	her	brains,	Bronwyn	can	be	like	a	little	kid	sometimes.
“What’s	 that	 worth?”	 I	 ask.	 “He’s	 not	 your	 lawyer.	 He	 can	 talk	 to
Mikhail	Powers	about	you	if	he	wants	more	airtime.”

“He	won’t,”	Bronwyn	says	calmly,	like	she’s	got	it	all	figured	out.
“Anyway,	I	didn’t	tell	him	anything.	We	didn’t	talk	about	me	at	all.	I
just	asked	him	what	he	thought	of	the	investigation	so	far.”

“And?”
“Well,	 he	 repeated	 some	 of	 what	 he	 said	 on	 TV.	 That	 he	 was
surprised	 there	 wasn’t	 more	 talk	 about	 Simon.	 Eli	 thought	 anyone
who’d	run	the	kind	of	app	Simon	did,	for	as	long	as	he	did,	would’ve
made	plenty	of	enemies	who’d	love	to	use	the	four	of	us	as	scapegoats.
He	said	he’d	check	into	some	of	the	most	damaging	stories	and	the
kids	they	covered.	And	he’d	look	into	Simon	generally.	Like	Maeve’s
doing	with	the	4chan	stuff.”

“The	best	defense	is	a	good	offense?”	I	ask.
“Right.	He	also	said	our	lawyers	aren’t	doing	enough	to	pick	apart
the	theory	that	nobody	else	could’ve	poisoned	Simon.	Mr.	Avery,	for
one.”	A	note	of	pride	creeps	into	her	voice.	“Eli	said	the	exact	same
thing	I	did,	that	Mr.	Avery	had	the	best	opportunity	of	anyone	to	plant
the	phones	and	doctor	the	cups.	But	other	than	questioning	him	a	few
times,	the	police	are	mostly	leaving	him	alone.”

I	shrug.	“What’s	his	motive?”
“Technophobia,”	Bronwyn	says,	and	glares	at	me	when	I	laugh.
“It’s	a	 _thing._ 	Anyway,	that	was	just	one	idea.	Eli	also	mentioned	the	car
accident	 as	 a	 time	 when	 everybody	 was	 distracted	 and	 someone
could’ve	slipped	into	the	room.”

I	frown	at	her.	“We	weren’t	at	the	window	that	long.	We	would’ve
heard	the	door	open.”

“Would	we?	Maybe	not.	His	point	is,	it’s	possible.	And	he	said
something	else	interesting.”	Bronwyn	picks	up	a	small	rock	and	juggles
it	meditatively	in	her	hand.	“He	said	he’d	look	into	the	car	accident.


That	the	timing	was	suspect.”

“Meaning?”
“Well,	 it	 goes	 back	 to	 his	 earlier	 point	 that	 someone	 could’ve
opened	the	door	while	we	watched	the	cars.	Someone	who	knew	it	was
going	to	happen.”

“He	thinks	the	car	accident	was	 _planned_ ?”	I	stare	at	her,	and	she
avoids	my	gaze	as	she	heaves	the	rock	over	the	trees	beneath	us.	“So
you’re	suggesting	somebody	engineered	a	fender	bender	in	the	parking
lot	so	they	could	distract	us,	slip	into	detention,	and	dump	peanut	oil
into	Simon’s	cup?	That	they	couldn’t	possibly	have	known	he	had	if
they	 weren’t	 already	 in	 the	 room?	 Then	 leave	 Simon’s	 cup	 lying
around,	because	they’re	stupid?”

“It’s	not	stupid	if	they’re	trying	to	frame	us,”	Bronwyn	points	out.
“But	it	would	be	stupid	for	one	of	us	to	leave	it	there,	instead	of	finding
a	way	to	get	rid	of	it.	Chances	were	good	nobody	would	have	searched
us	right	after.”

“It	 still	 doesn’t	 explain	 how	 anybody	 outside	 the	 room	 would
know	Simon	had	a	cup	of	water	in	the	first	place.”

“Well,	it’s	like	the	Tumblr	post	said.	Simon	was	always	drinking
water,	wasn’t	he?	They	could	have	been	outside	the	door,	watching
through	the	window.	That’s	what	Eli	says,	anyway.”

“Oh,	well,	if	 _Eli_ 	says	so.”	I’m	not	sure	why	this	guy’s	a	legal	god	in
Bronwyn’s	eyes.	He	can’t	be	more	than	twenty-five.	“Sounds	like	he’s
full	of	dipshit	theories.”

I’m	getting	ready	for	an	argument,	but	Bronwyn	doesn’t	take	the
bait.	“Maybe,”	she	says,	tracing	her	fingers	over	the	rock	between	us.
“But	I’ve	been	thinking	about	this	a	lot	lately	and...I	don’t	think	it	was
anyone	in	that	room,	Nate.	I	really	don’t.	I’ve	gotten	to	know	Addy	a
little	bit	this	week”—she	raises	a	palm	at	my	skeptical	look—“and	I’m
not	saying	I’m	suddenly	an	Addy	expert	or	anything,	but	I	honestly
can’t	picture	her	doing	anything	to	Simon.”

“What	about	Cooper?	That	guy’s	definitely	hiding	something.”
“Cooper’s	not	a	killer.”	Bronwyn	sounds	positive,	and	for	some
reason	that	pisses	me	off.

```
“You	 know	 this	 how?	 Because	 you	 guys	 are	 so	 close?	 Face	 it,
```

Bronwyn,	none	of	us	really	know	each	other.	Hell,	 _you_ 	could’ve	done	it.
You’re	smart	enough	to	plan	something	this	messed	up	and	get	away
with	it.”

I’m	kidding,	but	Bronwyn	goes	rigid.	“How	can	you	say	that?”	Her
cheeks	get	red,	giving	her	that	flushed	look	that	always	unsettles	me.
_She’ll	surprise	you	one	day	with	how	pretty	she	is._ 	My	mother	used	to
say	that	about	Bronwyn.

My	mother	was	wrong,	though.	There’s	nothing	surprising	about
it.

“Eli	said	it	himself,	right?”	I	say.	“Anything’s	possible.	Maybe	you
brought	me	here	to	shove	me	down	the	hill	and	break	my	neck.”

“You	brought	 _me_ 	here,”	Bronwyn	points	out.	Her	eyes	widen,	and
I	laugh.

“Oh,	come	on.	You	don’t	actually	think—	Bronwyn,	we’re	barely	on
an	incline.	Pushing	you	off	this	rock	isn’t	much	of	an	evil	plan	if	all
you’d	do	is	twist	your	ankle.”

“That’s	not	funny,”	Bronwyn	says,	but	a	smile	twitches	at	her	lips.
The	afternoon	sun’s	making	her	glow,	putting	glints	of	gold	in	her	dark
hair,	and	for	a	second	I	almost	can’t	breathe.

Jesus.	This	girl.
I	stand	and	hold	out	my	hand.	She	gives	me	a	skeptical	look,	but
takes	it	and	lets	me	pull	her	to	her	feet.	I	put	my	other	hand	in	the	air.
“Bronwyn	Rojas,	I	solemnly	swear	not	to	murder	you	today	or	at	any
point	in	the	future.	Deal?”

“You’re	ridiculous,”	she	mutters,	going	even	redder.
“It	concerns	me	you’re	avoiding	a	promise	not	to	murder	me.”
She	rolls	her	eyes.	“Do	you	say	that	to	all	the	girls	you	bring	here?”
Huh.	Maybe	she	knows	Marshall’s	Peak’s	reputation	after	all.
I	move	closer	until	there’s	only	a	couple	of	inches	between	us.
“You’re	still	not	answering	my	question.”

Bronwyn	leans	forward	and	brings	her	lips	to	my	ear.	She’s	so
close	I	can	feel	her	heart	beating	when	she	whispers,	“I	promise	not	to
murder	you.”

```
“That’s	hot.”	I	mean	it	as	a	joke,	but	my	voice	comes	out	like	a
```

growl	and	when	her	lips	part	I	kiss	her	before	she	can	laugh.	A	shock	of
energy	shoots	through	me	as	I	cup	her	face	in	my	hands,	my	fingers
grasping	her	cheeks	and	the	line	of	her	jaw.	It	must	be	the	adrenaline
that’s	making	my	heart	pound	so	fast.	The	whole	nobody-else-could-
possibly-understand-this	bond.	Or	maybe	it’s	her	soft	lips	and	green
apple–scented	hair,	and	the	way	she	winds	her	arms	around	my	neck
like	she	can’t	stand	to	let	go.	Either	way	I	keep	kissing	her	as	long	as
she	lets	me,	and	when	she	steps	away	I	try	to	pull	her	back	because	it
wasn’t	enough.

“Nate,	 my	 phone,”	 she	 says,	 and	 for	 the	 first	 time	 I	 notice	 a
persistent,	jangly	text	tone.	“It’s	my	sister.”

“She	can	wait,”	I	say,	tangling	a	hand	in	her	hair	and	kissing	along
her	jawline	to	her	neck.	She	shivers	against	me	and	makes	a	little	noise
in	her	throat.	Which	I	like.

“It’s	just...”	She	runs	her	fingertips	across	the	back	of	my	neck.
“She	wouldn’t	keep	texting	if	it	weren’t	important.”

Maeve’s	 our	 excuse—she	 and	 Bronwyn	 are	 supposed	 to	 be	 at
Yumiko’s	house	together—and	I	reluctantly	step	back	so	Bronwyn	can
reach	down	and	dig	her	phone	out	of	her	backpack.	She	looks	at	the
screen	and	draws	in	a	quick,	sharp	breath.	“Oh	God.	My	mom’s	trying
to	reach	me	too.	Robin	says	the	police	want	me	to	come	to	the	station.
To,	quote,	 _‘follow	up	on	a	couple	of	things.’_ 	Unquote.”

“Probably	the	same	bullshit.”	I	manage	to	sound	calm	even	though
it’s	not	how	I	feel.

“Did	they	call	you?”	she	asks.	She	looks	like	she	hopes	they	did,
and	hates	herself	for	it.

I	didn’t	hear	my	phone,	but	pull	it	out	of	my	pocket	to	check
anyway.	“No.”

She	nods	and	starts	firing	off	texts.	“Should	I	have	Maeve	pick	me
up	here?”

“Have	her	meet	us	at	my	house.	It’s	halfway	between	here	and	the
station.”	 As	 soon	 as	 I	 say	 it	 I	 kind	 of	 regret	 it—I	 still	 don’t	 want
Bronwyn	anywhere	near	my	house	when	it’s	light	out—but	it’s	the	most
convenient	option.	And	we	don’t	have	to	go	inside.

```
Bronwyn	bites	her	lip.	“What	if	reporters	are	there?”
```

“They	won’t	be.	They’ve	figured	out	no	one’s	ever	around.”	She
still	looks	worried,	so	I	add,	“Look,	we	can	park	at	my	neighbor’s	and
walk	over.	If	anyone’s	there,	I’ll	take	you	someplace	else.	But	trust	me,
it’ll	be	fine.”

Bronwyn	texts	Maeve	my	address	and	we	walk	to	the	edge	of	the
woods	where	I	left	my	bike.	I	help	her	with	the	helmet	and	she	climbs
behind	me,	wrapping	her	arms	around	my	waist	as	I	start	the	engine.

I	drive	slowly	down	narrow,	twisty	side	roads	until	we	reach	my
street.	My	neighbor’s	rusted	Chevrolet	sits	in	her	driveway,	in	the	exact
same	spot	it’s	been	for	the	past	five	years.	I	park	next	to	it,	wait	for
Bronwyn	to	dismount,	and	take	her	hand	as	we	make	our	way	through
the	neighbor’s	yard	to	mine.	As	we	get	closer	I	see	our	house	through
Bronwyn’s	eyes,	and	wish	I’d	bothered	to	mow	the	lawn	at	some	point
in	the	last	year.

Suddenly	she	stops	in	her	tracks	and	lets	out	a	gasp,	but	she’s	not
looking	at	our	knee-length	grass.	“Nate,	there’s	someone	at	your	door.”

I	stop	too	and	scan	the	street	for	a	news	van.	There	isn’t	one,	just	a
beat-up	Kia	parked	in	front	of	our	house.	Maybe	they’re	getting	better
at	camouflage.	“Stay	here,”	I	tell	Bronwyn,	but	she	comes	with	me	as	I
get	closer	to	my	driveway	for	a	better	look	at	whoever’s	at	the	door.

It’s	not	a	reporter.
My	 throat	 goes	 dry	 and	 my	 head	 starts	 to	 throb.	 The	 woman
pressing	the	bell	turns	around,	and	her	mouth	falls	open	a	little	when
she	sees	me.	Bronwyn	goes	still	beside	me,	her	hand	dropping	from
mine.	I	keep	walking	without	her.

I’m	surprised	how	normal	my	voice	sounds	when	I	speak.	“What’s
up,	Mom?”


**Bronwyn**

**Monday,	October	15,	4:10	p.m.**

Maeve	 pulls	 into	 the	 driveway	 seconds	 after	 Mrs.	 Macauley	 turns
around.	I	stand	rigid,	my	hands	clenched	at	my	sides	and	my	heart
pounding,	staring	at	the	woman	I	thought	was	dead.

“Bronwyn?”	Maeve	lowers	her	window	and	sticks	her	head	out	of
the	car.	“You	ready?	Mom	and	Robin	are	already	there.	Dad’s	trying	to
get	 off	 work,	 but	 he’s	 got	 a	 board	 meeting.	 I	 had	 to	 do	 some
maneuvering	 about	 why	 you	 weren’t	 answering	 your	 phone.	 You’re
sick	to	your	stomach,	okay?”

“That’s	accurate,”	I	mutter.	Nate’s	back	is	to	me.	His	mother	is
talking,	staring	at	him	with	ravenous	eyes,	but	I	can’t	hear	anything
she’s	saying.

“Huh?”	Maeve	follows	my	gaze.	“Who’s	that?”
“I’ll	tell	you	in	the	car,”	I	say,	tearing	my	eyes	away	from	Nate.
“Let’s	go.”

I	climb	into	the	passenger	seat	of	our	Volvo,	where	the	heat	is
blasting	because	Maeve’s	always	cold.	She	backs	out	of	the	driveway	in
her	careful,	just-got-my-license	way,	talking	the	whole	time.	“Mom’s
doing	that	whole	Mom	thing,	where	she’s	pretending	not	to	be	freaked
out	but	she	totally	is,”	she	says,	and	I’m	half	listening.	“I	guess	the
police	aren’t	giving	much	information.	We	don’t	even	know	if	anyone
else	is	going	to	be	there.	Is	Nate	coming,	do	you	know?”

I	snap	back	to	attention.	“No.”	For	once	I’m	glad	Maeve	likes	to
maintain	broiler-oven	temperatures	while	driving,	because	it’s	keeping
the	cold	inching	up	my	spine	at	bay.	“He’s	not	coming.”

Maeve	approaches	a	stop	sign	and	brakes	jerkily,	glancing	over	at
me.	“What’s	the	matter?”

```
I	close	my	eyes	and	lean	against	the	headrest.	“That	was	Nate’s
```

mother.”

“What	was?”
“The	woman	at	the	door	just	now.	At	Nate’s	house.	It	was	his
mother.”

“But...”	Maeve	trails	off,	and	I	can	tell	by	the	sound	of	the	blinker
that	she’s	about	to	make	a	turn	and	needs	to	concentrate.	When	the	car
straightens	again	she	says,	“But	she’s	dead.”

“Apparently	not.”
“I	don’t—but	that’s—”	Maeve	sputters	for	a	few	seconds.	I	keep	my
eyes	closed.	“So...what’s	the	deal?	Did	he	not	 _know_ 	she	was	alive?	Or
did	he	lie	about	it?”

“We	didn’t	exactly	have	time	to	discuss	it,”	I	say.
But	that’s	the	million-dollar	question.	I	remember	hearing	three
years	ago	through	the	grapevine	that	Nate’s	mother	had	died	in	a	car
accident.	We	lost	my	mom’s	brother	the	same	way,	and	I	felt	a	lot	of
empathy	for	Nate,	but	I’d	never	asked	him	about	it	back	then.	I	did
over	the	past	few	weeks,	though.	Nate	didn’t	like	to	talk	about	it.	All	he
said	was	he	hadn’t	heard	anything	about	his	mother	since	she	flaked
on	taking	him	to	Oregon,	until	he	got	news	that	she’d	died.	He	never
mentioned	a	funeral.	Or	much	of	anything,	really.

“Well.”	Maeve’s	voice	is	encouraging.	“Maybe	it’s	some	kind	of
miracle.	Like	it	was	all	a	horrible	misunderstanding	and	everybody
thought	she	was	dead	but	really	she...had	amnesia.	Or	was	in	a	coma.”

“Right,”	I	snort.	“And	maybe	Nate	has	an	evil	twin	who’s	behind	it
all.	 Because	 we’re	 living	 in	 a	 telenovela.”	 I	 think	 about	 Nate’s	 face
before	he	walked	away	from	me.	He	didn’t	seem	shocked.	Or	happy.
He	looked...stoic.	He	reminded	me	of	my	father	every	time	Maeve	had
a	relapse.	As	though	an	illness	he’d	been	dreading	had	come	back,	and
he	was	just	going	to	have	to	deal	with	it	now.

“We’re	here,”	Maeve	says,	pulling	to	a	careful	stop.	I	open	my	eyes.
“You’re	in	the	handicapped	space,”	I	tell	her.
“I’m	not	staying,	just	dropping	you	off.	Good	luck.”	She	reaches
over	and	squeezes	my	hand.	“I’m	sure	it’ll	be	fine.	All	of	it.”

I	walk	slowly	inside	and	give	my	name	to	the	woman	behind	the
glass	partition	in	the	lobby,	who	directs	me	to	a	conference	room	down


the	hall.	When	I	enter,	my	mother,	Robin,	and	Detective	Mendoza	are
all	already	seated	at	a	small	round	table.	My	heart	sinks	at	the	absence
of	Addy	or	Cooper,	and	at	the	sight	of	a	laptop	in	front	of	Detective
Mendoza.

Mom	gives	me	a	worried	look.	“How’s	your	stomach,	honey?”
“Not	great,”	I	say	truthfully,	slipping	into	a	chair	beside	her	and
dropping	my	backpack	on	the	floor.

“Bronwyn	isn’t	well,”	Robin	says	with	a	cool	look	toward	Detective
Mendoza.	She’s	in	a	sharp	navy	suit	and	a	long,	multistrand	necklace.
“This	should	be	a	discussion	between	you	and	me,	Rick.	I	can	loop
Bronwyn	and	her	parents	in	as	needed.”

Detective	Mendoza	presses	a	key	on	the	laptop.	“We	won’t	keep
you	long.	Always	better	to	talk	face	to	face,	in	my	opinion.	Bronwyn,
are	you	aware	Simon	used	to	have	a	companion	website	for	About
That,	where	he’d	write	longer	posts?”

Robin	 interrupts	 before	 I	 can	 speak.	 “Rick,	 I’m	 not	 letting
Bronwyn	answer	any	questions	until	you	tell	me	why	she’s	here.	If	you
have	something	to	show	or	tell	us,	please	get	to	that	first.”

“I	do,”	Detective	Mendoza	says,	rotating	the	laptop	so	it	faces	me.
“One	of	your	classmates	alerted	us	to	a	post	that	ran	eighteen	months
ago,	Bronwyn.	Does	this	look	familiar?”

My	mother	moves	her	chair	next	to	me	as	Robin	leans	over	my
shoulder.	I	focus	my	eyes	on	the	screen,	but	I	already	know	what	I’m
about	to	read.	I’ve	worried	for	weeks	that	it	might	come	up.

```
So	maybe	I	should	have	said	something.	But	it’s	too	late	now.
```
```
News	flash:	LV’s	end-of-the-year	party	isn’t	a	charity	event.	Just	so	we’re	clear.
You’d	be	excused	for	thinking	so,	though,	with	frosh	attendance	at	an	all-time
high.
Regular	readers	(and	if	you’re	not	one,	what	the	hell	is	wrong	with	you?)
know	I	try	to	cut	the	kids	some	slack.	Children	are	our	future	and	all	that.	But	let
me	do	a	little	PSA	for	one	new	(and	fleeting,	I’m	gonna	guess)	arrival	to	the
social	scene:	MR,	who	doesn’t	seem	to	realize	SC	is	out	of	her	league.
He’s	not	in	the	market	for	a	puppy,	kid.	Stop	with	the	following.	It’s	pathetic.
And,	guys,	don’t	give	me	that	poor-little-thing-had-cancer	crap.	Not
anymore.	M	can	put	on	her	big-girl	panties	like	anyone	else	and	learn	a	few
basic	rules:
```
```
1.Varsity	basketball	players	with	cheerleader	girlfriends	are	OFF	THE	MARKET.	I	shouldn’t
```

```
have	to	explain	this,	but	apparently	I	do.
2.Two	beers	are	too	many	when	you’re	a	lightweight,	because	it	leads	to:
3.The	worst	display	of	awkward	kitchen	table	dancing	I’ve	ever	seen.	Seriously,	M.	Never
again.
4.If	that	one	beer	makes	you	throw	up,	try	not	to	do	it	in	your	hosts’	washing	machine.
That’s	just	rude.
```
```
Let’s	card	at	the	door	from	now	on,	okay,	LV?	At	first	it’s	funny,	but	then	it’s
just	sad.
```
I	 stay	 still	 in	 my	 chair	 and	 try	 to	 keep	 my	 face	 impassive.	 I
remember	 that	 post	 like	 it	 was	 yesterday:	 how	 Maeve,	 who’d	 been
giddy	from	her	first	crush	and	her	first	party,	even	though	neither	had
gone	exactly	as	planned,	folded	into	herself	after	she	read	Simon’s	post
and	refused	to	go	out	again.	I	remember	all	the	impotent	rage	I’d	felt,
that	Simon	was	so	casually	cruel,	just	because	he	could	be.	Because	he
had	a	willing	audience	that	ate	it	up.

And	I	hated	him	for	it.
I	can’t	look	at	my	mother,	who	has	no	idea	any	of	this	happened,
so	I	focus	on	Robin.	If	she’s	surprised	or	concerned,	she	doesn’t	show
it.	“All	right.	I’ve	read	it.	Tell	me	what	you	think	the	significance	of	this
is,	Rick.”

“I’d	like	to	hear	that	from	Bronwyn.”
“No.”	Robin’s	voice	cracks	like	a	velvet	whip,	soft	but	unyielding.
“Explain	why	we’re	here.”

“This	post	appears	to	be	written	about	Bronwyn’s	sister,	Maeve.”
“What	makes	you	think	that?”	Robin	asks.
My	mother	chokes	out	a	furious,	disbelieving	laugh,	and	I	finally
sneak	a	look	at	her.	Her	face	is	bright	red,	her	eyes	burning.	Her	voice
shakes	when	she	speaks.	“Is	this	for	real?	You	bring	us	here	to	show	us
this	horrible	post	written	by	a—I	have	to	say,	a	boy	who	quite	clearly
had	 _issues_ —and	 for	 what?	 What	 are	 you	 hoping	 to	 accomplish,
exactly?”

Detective	Mendoza	tilts	his	head	in	her	direction.	“I’m	sure	this	is
difficult	to	read,	Mrs.	Rojas.	But	between	the	initials	and	the	cancer
diagnosis,	 it’s	 obvious	 Simon	 was	 writing	 about	 your	 younger
daughter.	There’s	no	other	current	or	past	student	at	Bayview	High
who	 fits	 that	 profile.”	 He	 turns	 toward	 me.	 “This	 must	 have	 been


humiliating	 for	 your	 sister,	 Bronwyn.	 And	 from	 what	 other	 kids	 at
school	have	told	us	recently,	she’s	never	really	participated	in	social
activities	since	then.	Did	that	make	you	resent	Simon?”

My	mother	opens	her	mouth	to	speak,	but	Robin	puts	a	hand	on
her	arm	and	cuts	her	off.	“Bronwyn	has	no	comment.”

Detective	Mendoza’s	eyes	gleam,	and	he	looks	as	though	he	can
barely	restrain	himself	from	grinning.	“Oh,	but	she	does.	Or	she	did,
anyway.	Simon	unpublished	the	blog	more	than	a	year	ago,	but	all	the
posts	and	comments	are	still	recorded	on	the	back	end.”	He	pulls	the
laptop	back	and	presses	a	few	keys,	then	spins	it	toward	us	with	a	new
window	 open.	 “You	 have	 to	 give	 your	 email	 address	 to	 leave	 a
comment.	This	is	yours,	right,	Bronwyn?”

“Anybody	can	leave	another	person’s	email	address,”	Robin	says
quickly.	 Then	 she	 leans	 over	 my	 shoulder	 again,	 and	 reads	 what	 I
wrote	at	the	end	of	sophomore	year.

```
Fuck	off	and	die,	Simon.

**Addy**

**Monday,	October	15,	4:15	p.m.**

The	road	from	my	house	to	Jake’s	is	a	pretty	smooth	ride	until	I	turn
onto	Clarendon	Street.	It’s	a	major	intersection,	and	I	have	to	get	to	the
far	left	without	the	help	of	a	bike	lane.	When	I	first	started	riding	again
I	used	to	head	for	the	sidewalk	and	cross	with	the	light,	but	now	I	whiz
across	three	lanes	of	traffic	like	a	pro.

I	cruise	into	Jake’s	driveway	and	push	the	kickstand	down	as	I
dismount,	pulling	off	my	helmet	and	looping	it	across	my	handlebars.	I
run	 a	 hand	 through	 my	 hair	 as	 I	 approach	 the	 house,	 but	 it’s	 a
pointless	gesture.	I’ve	gotten	used	to	the	cut	and	sometimes	I	even	like
it,	but	short	of	growing	it	a	foot	and	a	half	overnight,	there’s	nothing	I
can	do	to	improve	it	in	Jake’s	eyes.

I	ring	the	doorbell	and	step	back,	uncertainty	humming	through
my	veins.	I	don’t	know	why	I’m	here	or	what	I’m	hoping	for.

The	door	clicks	and	Jake	pulls	it	open.	He	looks	the	same	as	ever—
tousle-haired	and	blue-eyed,	in	a	perfectly	fitted	T-shirt	that	shows	off
his	football	season	workouts	to	great	effect.	“Hey.	Come	in.”

I	 instinctively	 turn	 toward	 the	 basement,	 but	 that’s	 not	 where
we’re	 headed.	 Instead,	 Jake	 leads	 me	 into	 the	 formal	 living	 room,


where	I’ve	spent	less	than	an	hour	total	since	I	started	dating	Jake
more	than	three	years	ago.	I	lower	myself	onto	his	parents’	leather	sofa
and	my	still-sweaty	legs	stick	to	it	almost	immediately.	Who	decided
leather	furniture	was	a	good	idea?

When	he	sits	down	across	from	me,	his	mouth	sets	in	such	a	hard
line	that	I	can	tell	this	won’t	be	a	reconciliation	conversation.	I	wait	for
crushing	disappointment	to	hit,	but	it	doesn’t.

“So	you	ride	a	bike	now?”	he	asks.
Of	 all	 the	 conversations	 we	 could	 have,	 I’m	 not	 sure	 why	 he’s
starting	with	this	one.	“I	don’t	have	a	car,”	I	remind	him.	 _And	you	used
to	drive	me	everywhere._

He	leans	forward	with	his	elbows	on	his	knees—such	a	familiar
gesture	that	I	almost	expect	him	to	start	chatting	about	football	season
like	 he	 would	 have	 a	 month	 ago.	 “How’s	 the	 investigation	 going?
Cooper	never	talks	about	it	anymore.	You	guys	still	all	under	the	gun,
or	what?”

I	 don’t	 want	 to	 talk	 about	 the	 investigation.	 The	 police	 have
questioned	me	a	couple	of	times	over	the	past	week,	always	finding
new	ways	to	ask	me	about	the	missing	EpiPens	in	the	nurse’s	office.
My	lawyer	tells	me	the	repetitive	questioning	means	the	investigation’s
going	nowhere,	not	that	I’m	their	main	suspect.	It’s	none	of	Jake’s
business,	though,	so	I	tell	him	a	stupid,	made-up	story	about	how	the
four	of	us	saw	Detective	Wheeler	eating	an	entire	plateful	of	doughnuts
in	an	interrogation	room.

Jake	rolls	his	eyes	when	I’m	done.	“So	basically,	they’re	getting
nowhere.”

“Bronwyn’s	 sister	 thinks	 people	 should	 be	 looking	 at	 Simon
more,”	I	say.

“Why	Simon?	He’s	dead,	for	crying	out	loud.”
“Because	it	might	turn	up	suspects	the	police	haven’t	thought	of
yet.	 Other	 people	 who	 had	 a	 reason	 for	 wanting	 Simon	 out	 of	 the
picture.”

Jake	blows	out	an	annoyed	sigh	and	flings	an	arm	across	the	back
of	his	chair.	“Blame	the	victim,	you	mean?	What	happened	to	Simon
wasn’t	 his	 fault.	 If	 people	 didn’t	 pull	 such	 sneaky,	 bullshit	 moves,
About	That	wouldn’t	even	have	existed.”	He	narrows	his	eyes	at	me.


“You	know	that	better	than	anyone.”

“Still	 doesn’t	 make	 him	 a	 great	 guy,”	 I	 counter,	 with	 a
stubbornness	that	surprises	me.	“About	That	hurt	a	lot	of	people.	I
don’t	understand	why	he	kept	it	up	for	so	long.	Did	he	like	people
being	afraid	of	him?	I	mean,	you	were	friends	with	him	growing	up,
right?	Was	he	always	that	way?	Is	that	why	you	stopped	hanging	out?”

“Are	you	doing	Bronwyn’s	investigative	work	for	her	now?”
Is	he	 _sneering_ 	at	me?	“I’m	as	curious	as	she	is.	Simon’s	kind	of	a
central	figure	in	my	life	now.”

He	snorts.	“I	didn’t	invite	you	here	to	argue	with	me.”
I	stare	at	him,	searching	for	something	familiar	in	his	face.	“I’m
not	arguing.	We’re	having	a	conversation.”	But	even	as	I	say	it,	I	try	to
remember	the	last	time	I	talked	to	Jake	and	didn’t	agree	one	hundred
percent	with	whatever	he	said.	I	can’t	come	up	with	a	thing.	I	reach	up
and	play	with	the	back	of	my	earring,	pulling	it	until	it	almost	comes
off	and	then	sliding	it	on	again.	It’s	a	nervous	habit	I’ve	developed	now
that	I	don’t	have	hair	to	wind	around	my	fingers.	“So	why	 _did_ 	you
invite	me	here?”

His	lip	curls	as	his	eyes	flick	away	from	me.	“Leftover	concern,	I
guess.	Plus,	I	deserve	to	know	what’s	happening.	I	keep	getting	calls
from	reporters	and	I’m	sick	of	it.”

He	sounds	like	he’s	waiting	for	an	apology.	But	I’ve	already	given
enough	of	those.	“So	am	I.”	He	doesn’t	say	anything,	and	as	silence
falls	I’m	acutely	aware	of	how	loud	the	clock	over	his	fireplace	is.	I
count	sixty-three	ticks	before	I	ask,	“Will	you	ever	be	able	to	forgive
me?”

I’m	not	even	sure	what	kind	of	forgiveness	I	want	anymore.	It’s
hard	to	imagine	going	back	to	being	Jake’s	girlfriend.	But	it	would	be
nice	if	he	stopped	hating	me.

His	nostrils	flare	and	his	mouth	pulls	into	a	bitter	twist.	“How
could	I?	You	cheated	on	me	and	lied	about	it,	Addy.	You’re	not	who	I
thought	you	were.”

I’m	starting	to	think	that’s	a	good	thing.	“I’m	not	going	to	make
excuses,	Jake.	I	screwed	up,	but	not	because	I	didn’t	care	about	you.	I
guess	I	never	thought	I	was	worthy	of	you.	Then	I	proved	it.”


His	cold	gaze	doesn’t	waver.	“Don’t	play	the	poor-me	card,	Addy.
You	knew	what	you	were	doing.”

“Okay.”	All	of	a	sudden	I	feel	like	I	did	when	Detective	Wheeler
first	interrogated	me:	 _I	don’t	have	to	talk	to	you._ 	Jake	might	be	getting
satisfaction	from	picking	at	the	scab	of	our	relationship,	but	I’m	not.	I
stand	up,	my	skin	making	a	faint	peeling	sound	as	it	unsticks	from	the
sofa.	I’m	sure	I’ve	left	two	thigh-shaped	imprints	behind.	Gross,	but
who	cares	anymore.	“I	guess	I’ll	see	you	around.”

I	let	myself	out	and	climb	onto	my	bike,	putting	on	my	helmet.	As
soon	as	it’s	clipped	tight	I	push	up	the	kickstand	and	I’m	pedaling	hard
down	Jake’s	driveway.	Once	my	heart	finds	a	comfortable	pounding
rhythm,	 I	 remember	 how	 it	 almost	 beat	 out	 of	 my	 chest	 when	 I
confessed	to	cheating	on	Jake.	I’d	never	felt	so	trapped	in	my	life.	I
thought	I’d	feel	the	same	way	in	his	living	room	today,	waiting	for	him
to	tell	me	again	I’m	not	good	enough.

But	I	didn’t,	and	I	don’t.	For	the	first	time	in	a	long	time,	I	feel
free.

**Cooper**

**Monday,	October	15,	4:20	p.m.**

My	life	isn’t	mine	anymore.	It’s	been	taken	over	by	a	media	circus.
There	 aren’t	 reporters	 in	 front	 of	 my	 house	 every	 day,	 but	 it’s	 a
common-enough	occurrence	that	my	stomach	hurts	whenever	I	get
close	to	home.

I	try	not	to	go	online	more	than	I	have	to.	I	used	to	dream	about
my	name	being	a	trending	search	on	Google,	but	for	pitching	a	no-
hitter	in	the	World	Series.	Not	for	possibly	killing	a	guy	with	peanut
oil.

Everyone	says,	 _Just	keep	your	head	down._ 	I’ve	been	trying,	but
once	you’re	under	a	microscope	nothing	slips	by	people.	Last	Friday	at
school	I	got	out	of	my	car	the	same	time	Addy	got	out	of	her	sister’s,
the	breeze	ruffling	her	short	hair.	We	were	both	wearing	sunglasses,	a
pointless	attempt	at	blending	in,	and	gave	each	other	our	usual	tight-
lipped,	 still-can’t-believe-this-is-happening	 smile.	 We	 hadn’t	 gone
more	than	a	few	steps	before	we	saw	Nate	stride	over	to	Bronwyn’s	car
and	open	the	door,	being	all	exaggeratedly	polite	about	it.	He	smirked
as	 she	 got	 out,	 and	 she	 gave	 him	 a	 look	 that	 made	 Addy	 and	 me
exchange	glances	behind	our	shades.	The	four	of	us	ended	up	almost	in


a	line,	walking	toward	the	back	entrance.

The	whole	thing	barely	took	a	minute—just	enough	time	for	one	of
our	classmates	to	record	a	phone	video	that	wound	up	on	TMZ	that
night.	They	ran	it	in	slo-mo	with	the	song	“Kids”	by	MGMT	playing	in
the	background,	like	we’re	some	kind	of	hip	high	school	murder	club
without	a	care	in	the	world.	The	thing	went	viral	within	a	day.

That	might	be	the	weirdest	thing	about	all	this.	Plenty	of	people
hate	us	and	want	us	in	jail,	but	there	are	just	as	many—if	not	more—
who	love	us.	All	of	a	sudden	I	have	a	Facebook	fan	page	with	over	fifty
thousand	likes.	Mostly	girls,	according	to	my	brother.

The	attention	slows	sometimes,	but	it	never	really	stops.	I	thought
I’d	avoided	it	tonight	when	I	left	my	house	to	meet	Luis	at	the	gym,	but
as	soon	as	I	arrive	a	pretty,	dark-haired	woman	with	a	face	full	of
makeup	hurries	toward	me.	My	heart	sinks	because	I’m	familiar	with
her	type.	I’ve	been	followed	again.

“Cooper,	 do	 you	 have	 a	 few	 minutes?	 Liz	 Rosen	 with	 Channel
Seven	News.	I’d	love	your	perspective	on	all	this.	A	lot	of	people	are
rooting	for	you!”

I	don’t	answer,	brushing	past	her	through	the	gym’s	entrance.	She
clicks	after	me	in	her	high	heels,	a	cameraman	trailing	in	her	wake,	but
the	guy	at	the	front	desk	stops	them	both.	I’ve	been	going	there	for
years	and	they’ve	been	pretty	cool	through	all	this.	I	disappear	down
the	hall	while	he	argues	with	her	that	no,	she	can’t	buy	a	membership
on	the	spot.

Luis	 and	 I	 bench-press	 for	 a	 while,	 but	 I’m	 preoccupied	 with
what’s	waiting	outside	for	me	when	we’re	done.	We	don’t	talk	about	it,
but	in	the	locker	room	afterward	he	says,	“Give	me	your	shirt	and
keys.”

“What?”
“I’ll	be	you,	head	out	of	here	in	your	cap	and	sunglasses.	They
won’t	know	the	difference.	Take	my	car	and	get	the	hell	out	of	here.	Go
home,	go	out,	whatever.	We	can	swap	cars	again	at	school	tomorrow.”

I’m	about	to	tell	him	that’ll	never	work.	His	hair’s	a	lot	darker	than
mine,	and	he’s	at	least	a	shade	tanner.	Then	again,	with	a	long-sleeved
shirt	and	a	cap	on,	it	might	not	matter.	Worth	a	shot,	anyway.

```
So	I	hover	in	the	hallway	as	Luis	strides	out	the	front	door	in	my
```

clothes	to	the	bright	lights	of	cameras.	My	baseball	cap	sits	low	on	his
forehead	and	his	hand	shields	his	face	as	he	climbs	into	my	Jeep.	He
peels	out	of	the	parking	lot	and	a	couple	of	vans	follow.

I	put	on	Luis’s	hat	and	sunglasses,	then	get	into	his	Honda	and
fling	my	gym	bag	across	the	seat.	It	takes	a	few	tries	to	start	the	engine,
but	once	it	roars	I	pull	out	of	the	parking	lot	and	take	back	roads	until
I’m	on	the	highway	toward	San	Diego.	When	I’m	downtown	I	circle	for
half	an	hour,	still	paranoid	someone’s	following	me.	Eventually	I	make
my	way	to	the	North	Park	neighborhood,	pulling	in	front	of	an	old
factory	that	was	renovated	into	condos	last	year.

The	neighborhood’s	trendy,	with	lots	of	well-dressed	kids	a	little
older	than	me	filling	the	sidewalk.	A	pretty	girl	in	a	flowered	dress
almost	doubles	over	laughing	at	something	the	guy	next	to	her	says.
She	clutches	his	arm	as	they	pass	Luis’s	car	without	looking	my	way,
and	I	feel	a	bone-deep	sense	of	loss.	I	was	like	them	a	few	weeks	ago,
and	now	I’m...not.

I	shouldn’t	be	here.	What	if	someone	recognizes	me?
I	pull	a	key	out	of	my	gym	bag	and	wait	for	a	break	in	the	sidewalk
crowds.	I’m	out	of	Luis’s	car	and	in	the	front	door	so	fast,	I	don’t	think
anyone	could’ve	seen	me.	I	duck	into	the	elevator	and	take	it	to	the	top
floor,	letting	out	a	sigh	of	relief	when	it	doesn’t	stop	once.	The	hallway
echoes	with	empty	silence;	all	the	hipsters	who	live	here	must	be	out
for	the	afternoon.

Except	one,	I	hope.
When	I	knock,	I	only	half	expect	an	answer.	I	never	called	or
texted	to	say	I	was	coming.	But	the	door	cracks	open,	and	a	pair	of
startled	green	eyes	meet	mine.

_“Hey.”_ 	Kris	steps	aside	to	let	me	in.	“What	are	you	doing	here?”
“Had	to	get	out	of	my	house.”	I	close	the	door	behind	me	and	take
off	my	hat	and	sunglasses,	tossing	them	on	an	entry	table.	I	feel	silly,
like	a	kid	who’s	been	caught	playing	spy.	Except	people	 _are_ 	following
me.	Just	not	right	this	second.	“Plus,	I	guess	we	should	talk	about	the
whole	Simon	thing,	huh?”

“Later.”	Kris	hesitates	a	fraction	of	a	second,	then	leans	forward
and	pulls	me	roughly	toward	him,	pressing	his	lips	against	mine.	I
close	my	eyes	and	the	world	around	me	fades,	like	it	always	does,	when


I	slide	my	hands	into	his	hair	and	kiss	him	back.



**Nate**

**Monday,	October	15,	4:30	p.m.**

My	mother’s	upstairs,	trying	to	have	a	conversation	with	my	father.
Good	luck	with	that.	I’m	on	our	couch	with	my	burner	phone	in	hand,
wondering	what	I	can	text	to	Bronwyn	to	keep	her	from	hating	me.	Not
sure	 _Sorry	I	lied	about	my	mom	being	dead_ 	is	going	to	cut	it.

It’s	not	like	I	wanted	her	dead.	But	I	thought	she	probably	was,	or
would	be	soon.	And	it	was	easier	than	saying,	or	thinking,	the	truth.
_She’s	a	coke	addict	who	ran	off	to	some	commune	in	Oregon	and
hasn’t	talked	to	me	since._ 	So	when	people	started	asking	where	my
mother	was,	I	lied.	By	the	time	it	hit	me	how	fucked	up	a	response	that
was,	it	was	too	late	to	take	it	back.

Nobody’s	ever	really	cared,	anyway.	Most	of	the	people	I	know
don’t	pay	attention	to	what	I	say	or	do,	as	long	as	I	keep	the	drugs
coming.	Except	Officer	Lopez,	and	now	Bronwyn.

I	thought	about	telling	her,	a	few	times	late	at	night	while	we	were
talking.	But	I	could	never	figure	out	how	to	start	the	conversation.	I
still	can’t.

I	put	my	phone	away.
The	stairs	creak	as	my	mother	comes	down,	brushing	her	hands
on	the	front	of	her	pants.	“Your	father’s	not	in	any	shape	to	talk	right
now.”

“Shocking,”	I	mutter.
She	looks	both	older	and	younger	than	she	used	to.	Her	hair’s	a	lot
grayer	 and	 shorter,	 but	 her	 face	 isn’t	 so	 ragged	 and	 drawn.	 She’s
heavier,	which	I	guess	is	good.	Means	she’s	eating,	anyway.	She	crosses
over	to	Stan’s	terrarium	and	gives	me	a	small,	nervous	smile.	“Nice	to
see	Stan’s	still	around.”

```
“Not	much	has	changed	since	we	last	saw	you,”	I	say,	putting	my
```

feet	on	the	coffee	table	in	front	of	me.	“Same	bored	lizard,	same	drunk
dad,	same	falling-apart	house.	Except	now	I’m	being	investigated	for
murder.	Maybe	you	heard	about	that?”

“Nathaniel.”	My	mother	sits	in	the	armchair	and	clasps	her	hands
in	front	of	her.	Her	nails	are	as	bitten	off	as	ever.	“I—I	don’t	even	know
where	to	start.	I’ve	been	sober	for	almost	three	months	and	I’ve	wanted
to	contact	you	every	single	second.	But	I	was	so	afraid	I	wasn’t	strong
enough	yet	and	I’d	let	you	down	again.	Then	I	saw	the	news.	I’ve	been
coming	by	the	last	few	days,	but	you’re	never	home.”

I	gesture	at	the	cracked	walls	and	sagging	ceiling.	“Would	you	be?”
Her	face	crumples.	“I’m	sorry,	Nathaniel.	I	hoped...I	hoped	your
father	would	step	up.”

_You_ 	hoped.	 _Solid	parenting	plan._ 	“At	least	he’s	here.”	It’s	a	low
blow,	and	not	a	ringing	endorsement	since	the	guy	barely	moves,	but	I
feel	entitled	to	it.

My	 mother	 nods	 her	 head	 jerkily	 while	 cracking	 her	 knuckles.
God,	I	forgot	she	did	that.	It’s	fucking	annoying.	“I	know.	I	have	no
right	to	criticize.	I	don’t	expect	you	to	forgive	me.	Or	believe	you’ll	get
anything	better	than	what	you’re	used	to	from	me.	But	I’m	finally	on
meds	that	work	and	don’t	make	me	sick	with	anxiety.	It’s	the	only
reason	I	could	finish	rehab	this	time.	I	have	a	whole	team	of	doctors	in
Oregon	who’ve	been	helping	me	stay	sober.”

“Must	be	nice.	To	have	a	team.”
“It’s	more	than	I	deserve,	I	know.”	Her	downcast	eyes	and	humble
tone	are	pissing	me	off.	But	I’m	pretty	sure	anything	she	did	would	piss
me	off	right	now.

I	get	to	my	feet.	“This	has	been	great,	but	I	need	to	be	somewhere.
You	can	let	yourself	out,	right?	Unless	you	want	to	hang	with	Dad.
Sometimes	he	wakes	up	around	ten.”

Oh	crap.	Now	she’s	crying.	“I’m	sorry,	Nathaniel.	You	deserve	so
much	better	than	 the	two	of	 us.	My	 God,	just	look	 at	you—I	 can’t
believe	how	handsome	you’ve	gotten.	And	you’re	smarter	than	both
your	parents	put	together.	You	always	were.	You	should	be	living	in
one	of	those	big	houses	in	Bayview	Hills,	not	taking	care	of	this	dump
on	your	own.”

```
“Whatever,	 Mom.	 It’s	 all	 good.	 Nice	 to	 see	 you.	 Send	 me	 a
```

postcard	from	Oregon	sometime.”

“Nathaniel,	please.”	She	stands	and	tugs	at	my	arm.	Her	hands
look	 twenty	 years	 older	 than	 the	 rest	 of	 her—soft	 and	 wrinkled,
covered	with	brown	spots	and	scars.	“I	want	to	do	something	to	help
you.	Anything.	I’m	staying	in	the	Motel	Six	on	Bay	Road.	Could	I	take
you	out	to	dinner	tomorrow?	Once	you’ve	had	some	time	to	process	all
this?”

_Process	this._ 	Christ.	What	kind	of	rehab-speak	is	she	spewing?	“I
don’t	know.	Leave	a	number,	I’ll	call	you.	Maybe.”

“Okay.”	She’s	nodding	like	a	puppet	again	and	I’m	going	to	lose	it
if	I	don’t	get	away	from	her	soon.	“Nathaniel,	was	that	Bronwyn	Rojas	I
saw	earlier?”

“Yeah,”	I	say,	and	she	smiles.	“Why?”
“It’s	just...well,	if	that’s	who	you’re	with,	we	can’t	have	messed	you
up	too	badly.”

“I’m	not	 _with_ 	Bronwyn.	We’re	murder	cosuspects,	remember?”	I
say,	and	let	the	door	slam	behind	me.	Which	is	self-defeating,	because
when	it	comes	off	its	hinges,	 _again,_ 	I’m	the	one	who’ll	have	to	fix	it.

Once	I’m	outside,	I	don’t	know	where	to	go.	I	get	on	my	bike	and
head	for	downtown	San	Diego,	then	change	my	mind	and	get	on	I-15
North.	And	just	keep	riding,	stopping	after	an	hour	to	fill	up	my	tank.	I
pull	 out	 my	 burner	 phone	 while	 I’m	 doing	 it	 and	 check	 messages.
Nothing.	 I	 should	 call	 Bronwyn,	 see	 how	 things	 went	 at	 the	 police
station.	She’s	gotta	be	fine,	though.	She	has	that	expensive	lawyer,
along	with	parents	who	are	like	guard	dogs	between	her	and	people
trying	to	mess	with	her.	And	anyway,	what	the	hell	would	I	say?

I	put	my	phone	away.
I	ride	for	almost	three	hours	until	I	hit	wide	desert	roads	dotted
with	scrubby	bushes.	Even	though	it’s	getting	late,	it’s	hotter	here	near
the	Mojave	Desert,	and	I	stop	to	take	off	my	jacket	as	I	cruise	closer	to
Joshua	Tree.	The	only	vacation	I	ever	went	on	with	my	parents	was	a
camping	trip	here	when	I	was	nine	years	old.	I	spent	the	whole	time
waiting	 for	 something	 bad	 to	 happen:	 for	 our	 ancient	 car	 to	 break
down,	for	my	mother	to	start	screaming	or	crying,	for	my	dad	to	go	still
and	silent	like	he	always	did	when	we	got	to	be	too	much	for	him	to
take.


It	was	almost	normal,	though.	They	were	as	tense	with	each	other
as	ever,	but	kept	the	arguing	to	a	minimum.	My	mother	was	on	good
behavior,	maybe	because	she	had	a	thing	for	those	short,	twisted	trees
that	were	everywhere.	“The	first	seven	years	of	the	Joshua	tree’s	life,
it’s	 just	 a	 vertical	 stem.	 No	 branches,”	 she	 told	 me	 while	 we	 were
hiking.	“It	takes	years	before	it	blooms.	And	every	branching	stem
stops	growing	after	it	blossoms,	so	you’ve	got	this	complex	system	of
dead	areas	and	new	growth.”

I	used	to	think	about	that,	sometimes,	when	I	wondered	what
parts	of	her	might	still	be	alive.

```

```
It’s	past	midnight	by	the	time	I	get	back	to	Bayview.	I	thought	about
getting	on	I-15	and	riding	through	the	night,	as	far	as	I	could	go	until	I
dropped	from	exhaustion.	Let	my	parents	have	whatever	fucked-up
reunion	they’re	about	to	get	into	on	their	own.	Let	the	Bayview	Police
come	find	me	if	they	ever	want	to	talk	to	me	again.	But	that’s	what	my
mother	would	do.	So	in	the	end	I	came	back,	checked	my	phones,	and
followed	up	on	the	only	text	I	had:	a	party	at	Chad	Posner’s	house.

When	I	get	there	Posner’s	nowhere	to	be	found.	I	end	up	in	his
kitchen,	nursing	a	beer	and	listening	to	two	girls	go	on	and	on	about	a
TV	show	I’ve	never	seen.	It’s	boring	and	doesn’t	take	my	mind	off	my
mother’s	sudden	reappearance,	or	Bronwyn’s	police	summons.

One	of	the	girls	starts	to	giggle.	“I	know	you,”	she	says,	poking	me
in	 the	 side.	 She	 giggles	 harder	 and	 flattens	 her	 palm	 against	 my
stomach.	“You	were	on	 _Mikhail	Powers	Investigates,_ 	weren’t	you?	One
of	the	kids	who	maybe	killed	that	guy?”	She’s	half-drunk	and	staggers
as	she	leans	closer.	She	looks	like	a	lot	of	the	girls	I	meet	at	Posner’s
parties:	pretty	in	a	forgettable	way.

“Oh	my	God,	Mallory,”	her	friend	says.	“That’s	so	rude.”
“Not	me,”	I	say.	“I	just	look	like	him.”
“Liar.”	Mallory	tries	to	poke	me	again,	but	I	step	out	of	reach.
“Well,	I	don’t	think	you	did	it.	Neither	does	Brianna.	Right,	Bri?”	Her
friend	nods.	“We	think	it	was	the	girl	with	the	glasses.	She	looks	like	a
stuck-up	bitch.”

My	hand	tightens	around	my	beer	bottle.	“I	told	you,	that’s	not
me.	So	you	can	drop	it.”


“Shhorry,”	Mallory	slurs,	tilting	her	head	and	shaking	bangs	out	of
her	eyes.	“Don’t	be	such	a	grouch.	I	bet	I	can	cheer	you	up.”	She	slides
a	hand	into	her	pocket	and	pulls	out	a	crumpled	baggie	filled	with	tiny
squares.	“Wanna	go	upstairs	with	us	and	trip	for	a	while?”

I	hesitate.	I’d	do	almost	anything	to	get	out	of	my	head	right	now.
It’s	the	Macauley	family	way.	And	everybody	already	thinks	I’m	that
guy.

_Almost	everybody._ 	“Can’t,”	I	say,	pulling	out	my	burner	phone
and	starting	to	shoulder	my	way	through	the	crowd.	It	buzzes	before	I
get	outside.	When	I	look	at	the	screen	and	see	Bronwyn’s	number—
even	though	she’s	the	only	one	who	ever	calls	me	on	this	phone—I	feel
a	massive	sense	of	relief.	Like	I’ve	been	freezing	and	someone	wrapped
a	blanket	around	me.

“Hey,”	Bronwyn	says	when	I	pick	up.	Her	voice	is	far	away,	quiet.
“Can	we	talk?”

**Bronwyn**

**Tuesday,	October	16,	12:30	a.m.**

I’m	 nervous	 about	 sneaking	 Nate	 into	 the	 house.	 My	 parents	 are
already	furious	with	me	for	not	telling	them	about	Simon’s	blog	post—
both	now	and	back	when	it	actually	happened.	We	got	out	of	the	police
station	without	much	trouble,	though.	Robin	gave	this	haughty	speech
that	was	all,	 _Stop	wasting	our	time	with	meaningless	speculation	that
you	can’t	prove,	and	that	wouldn’t	be	actionable	even	if	you	did._

I	guess	she	was	right,	because	here	I	am.	Although	I’m	grounded
until,	as	my	mother	says,	I	stop	“undermining	my	future	by	not	being
transparent.”

“You	couldn’t	have	hacked	into	Simon’s	old	blog	while	you	were	at
it?”	I	muttered	to	Maeve	before	she	went	to	bed.

She	looked	genuinely	chagrined.	“He	took	it	down	so	long	ago!	I
didn’t	think	it	even	existed	anymore.	And	I	never	knew	you	wrote	that
comment.	It	wasn’t	posted.”	She	shook	her	head	at	me	with	a	sort	of
exasperated	fondness.	“You	were	always	more	upset	about	that	than	I
was,	Bronwyn.”

Maybe	she’s	right.	It	occurred	to	me,	as	I	lay	in	my	dark	room
debating	whether	I	should	call	Nate,	that	I’ve	spent	years	thinking
Maeve	was	a	lot	more	fragile	than	she	actually	is.


Now	I’m	downstairs	in	our	media	room,	and	when	I	get	a	text
from	Nate	that	he’s	at	the	house,	I	open	the	basement	door	and	stick
my	head	outside.	“Over	here,”	I	call	softly,	and	a	shadowy	figure	comes
around	 the	 corner	 next	 to	 our	 bulkhead.	 I	 retreat	 back	 into	 the
basement,	leaving	the	door	open	for	Nate	to	follow	me.

He	comes	in	wearing	a	leather	jacket	over	a	torn,	rumpled	T-shirt,
his	hair	falling	sweaty	across	his	forehead	from	the	helmet.	I	don’t	say
anything	until	I’ve	led	him	into	the	media	room	and	closed	the	door
behind	us.	My	parents	are	three	floors	away	and	asleep,	but	the	added
bonus	of	a	soundproof	room	can’t	be	overstated	at	a	time	like	this.

“So.”	I	sit	in	one	corner	of	the	couch,	knees	bent	and	arms	crossed
over	my	legs	like	a	barrier.	Nate	takes	off	his	jacket	and	tosses	it	on	the
floor,	lowering	himself	on	the	opposite	end.	When	he	meets	my	eyes,
his	are	clouded	with	so	much	misery	that	I	almost	forget	to	be	upset.

“How’d	it	go	at	the	police	station?”	he	asks.
“Fine.	But	that’s	not	what	I	want	to	talk	about.”
He	drops	his	eyes.	“I	know.”	Silence	stretches	between	us	and	I
want	to	fill	it	with	a	dozen	questions,	but	I	don’t.	“You	must	think	I’m
an	asshole,”	he	says	finally,	still	staring	at	the	floor.	“And	a	liar.”

“Why	didn’t	you	tell	me?”
Nate	exhales	a	slow	breath	and	shakes	his	head.	“I	wanted	to.	I
thought	about	it.	I	didn’t	know	how	to	start.	Thing	is—it	was	this	lie	I
told	because	it	was	easier	than	the	truth.	And	because	I	half	believed	it,
anyway.	 I	 didn’t	 think	 she’d	 ever	 come	 back.	 Then	 once	 you	 say
something	 like	 that,	 how	 do	 you	 unsay	 it?	 You	 look	 like	 a	 fucking
psycho	at	that	point.”	He	raises	his	eyes	again,	locking	on	mine	with
sudden	intensity.	“I’m	not,	though.	I	haven’t	lied	to	you	about	anything
else.	 I’m	 not	 dealing	 drugs	 anymore,	 and	 I	 didn’t	 do	 anything	 to
Simon.	I	don’t	blame	you	if	you	don’t	believe	me,	but	I	swear	to	God
it’s	true.”

Another	long	silence	descends	while	I	try	to	gather	my	thoughts.	I
should	 be	 angrier,	 probably.	 I	 should	 demand	 proof	 of	 his
trustworthiness,	even	though	I	have	no	idea	what	that	would	look	like.
I	should	ask	lots	of	pointed	questions	designed	to	ferret	out	whatever
other	lies	he’s	told	me.

```
But	the	thing	is,	I	do	believe	him.	I	won’t	pretend	I	know	Nate
```

inside	 and	 out	 after	 a	 few	 weeks,	 but	 I	 know	 what	 it’s	 like	 to	 tell
yourself	a	lie	so	often	that	it	becomes	the	truth.	I	did	it,	and	I	haven’t
had	to	muddle	through	life	almost	completely	on	my	own.

And	I’ve	never	thought	he	had	it	in	him	to	kill	Simon.
“Tell	me	about	your	mom.	For	real,	okay?”	I	ask.	And	he	does.	We
talk	for	over	an	hour,	but	after	the	first	fifteen	minutes	or	so,	we’re
mainly	covering	old	ground.	I	start	feeling	stiff	from	sitting	so	long,
and	lift	my	arms	over	my	head	in	a	stretch.

“Tired?”	Nate	asks,	moving	closer.
I	wonder	if	he’s	noticed	that	I’ve	been	staring	at	his	mouth	for	the
past	ten	minutes.	“Not	really.”

He	reaches	out	and	pulls	my	legs	over	his	lap,	tracing	a	circle	on
my	 left	 knee	 with	 his	 thumb.	 My	 legs	 tremble,	 and	 I	 press	 them
together	to	make	it	stop.	His	eyes	flick	toward	mine,	then	down.	“My
mother	thought	you	were	my	girlfriend.”

Maybe	if	I	do	something	with	my	hands	I	can	manage	to	hold	still.
I	reach	up	and	tangle	my	fingers	into	the	hair	on	the	nape	of	his	neck,
smoothing	the	soft	waves	against	his	warm	skin.	“Well.	I	mean.	Is	that
out	of	the	question?”

_Oh	God._ 	I	actually	said	it.	What	if	it	is?
Nate’s	hand	moves	down	my	leg,	almost	absently.	Like	he	has	no
idea	he’s	turning	my	entire	body	into	jelly.	“You	want	a	drug-dealing
murder	 suspect	 who	 lied	 about	 his	 not-dead	 mother	 as	 your
boyfriend?”

“Former	 drug	 dealer,”	 I	 correct.	 “And	 I’m	 not	 in	 a	 position	 to
judge.”

He	looks	up	with	a	half	smile,	but	his	eyes	are	wary.	“I	don’t	know
how	to	be	with	somebody	like	you,	Bronwyn.”	He	must	see	my	face	fall,
because	he	quickly	adds,	“I’m	not	saying	I	don’t	want	to.	I’m	saying	I
think	I’d	screw	it	up.	I’ve	only	ever	been...you	know.	Casual	about	this
kind	of	thing.”

I	don’t	know.	I	pull	my	hands	back	and	twist	them	in	my	lap,
watching	my	pulse	jump	under	the	thin	skin	of	my	wrist.	“Are	you
casual	now?	With	somebody	else?”

```
“No,”	Nate	says.	“I	was.	When	you	and	I	first	started	talking.	But
```

not	since	then.”

“Well.”	I’m	quiet	for	a	few	seconds,	weighing	whether	I’m	about	to
make	a	giant	mistake.	Probably,	but	I	plow	ahead	anyway.	“I’d	like	to
try.	If	you	want	to.	Not	because	we’re	thrown	together	in	this	weird
situation	and	I	think	you’re	hot,	although	I	do.	But	because	you’re
smart,	and	funny,	and	you	do	the	right	thing	more	often	than	you	give
yourself	credit	for.	I	like	your	horrible	taste	in	movies	and	the	way	you
never	sugarcoat	anything	and	the	fact	that	you	have	an	actual	lizard.
I’d	be	proud	to	be	your	girlfriend,	even	in	a	nonofficial	capacity	while
we’re,	you	know,	being	investigated	for	murder.	Plus,	I	can’t	go	more
than	a	few	minutes	without	wanting	to	kiss	you,	so—there’s	that.”

Nate	doesn’t	reply	at	first,	and	I	worry	I’ve	blown	it.	Maybe	that
was	too	much	information.	But	he’s	still	running	his	hand	down	my
leg,	and	finally	he	says,	“You’re	doing	better	than	me.	I	never	stop
thinking	about	kissing	you.”

He	takes	off	my	glasses	and	folds	them,	putting	them	on	the	side
table	next	to	the	couch.	His	hand	on	my	face	is	featherlight	as	he	leans
in	close	and	pulls	my	mouth	toward	his.	I	hold	my	breath	as	our	lips
connect,	and	the	soft	pressure	sends	a	warm	ache	humming	through
my	veins.	It’s	sweet	and	tender,	different	from	the	hot,	needy	kiss	at
Marshall’s	Peak.	But	it	still	makes	me	dizzy.	I’m	shaking	all	over	and
press	 my	 hands	 against	 his	 chest	 to	 try	 to	 get	 that	 under	 control,
feeling	a	hard	plane	of	muscle	through	his	thin	shirt.	 _Not	helping._

My	lips	part	in	a	sigh	that	turns	into	a	small	moan	when	Nate
slides	 his	 tongue	 to	 meet	 mine.	 Our	 kisses	 grow	 deeper	 and	 more
intense,	our	bodies	so	tangled	I	can’t	tell	where	mine	stops	and	his
starts.	I	feel	like	I’m	falling,	floating,	flying.	All	at	once.	We	kiss	until
my	lips	are	sore	and	my	skin	sparks	like	I’ve	been	lit	by	a	fuse.

Nate’s	hands	are	surprisingly	PG.	He	touches	my	hair	and	face	a
lot,	and	eventually	he	slides	a	hand	under	my	shirt	and	runs	it	over	my
back	and	oh	God,	I	might	have	whimpered.	His	fingers	dip	into	the
waistband	of	my	shorts	and	a	shiver	goes	through	me,	but	he	stops
there.	The	insecure	side	of	me	wonders	if	he’s	not	as	attracted	to	me	as
I	am	to	him,	or	as	he	is	to	other	girls.	Except...I’ve	been	pressed	against
him	for	half	an	hour	and	I	 _know_ 	that’s	not	it.

He	pulls	back	and	looks	at	me,	his	thick	dark	lashes	sweeping	low.
_God,_ 	his	eyes.	They’re	ridiculous.	“I	keep	picturing	your	father	walking


in,”	he	murmurs.	“He	kinda	scares	me.”	I	sigh	because,	truth	be	told,
that’s	been	in	the	back	of	my	mind	too.	Even	though	there’s	barely	a
five	percent	chance,	it’s	still	too	much.

Nate	runs	a	finger	over	my	lips.	“Your	mouth	is	so	red.	We	should
take	a	break	before	I	do	permanent	damage.	Plus,	I	need	to,	um,	calm
down	a	little.”	He	kisses	my	cheek	and	reaches	for	his	jacket	on	the
floor.

My	heart	drops.	“Are	you	leaving?”
“No.”	He	takes	his	phone	out	of	his	pocket	and	pulls	up	Netflix,
then	hands	me	my	glasses.	“We	can	finally	finish	watching	 _Ringu._ ”

“Damn	 it.	 I	 thought	 you’d	 forgotten	 about	 that.”	 My
disappointment’s	fake	this	time,	though.

“Come	on,	this	is	perfect.”	Nate	stretches	on	the	couch	and	I	curl
next	to	him	with	my	head	on	his	shoulder	as	he	props	his	iPhone	in	the
crook	 of	 his	 arm.	 “We’ll	 use	 my	 phone	 instead	 of	 that	 sixty-inch
monster	on	your	wall.	You	can’t	be	scared	of	anything	on	such	a	tiny
screen.”

Honestly,	I	don’t	care	what	we	do.	I	just	want	to	stay	wrapped
around	him	for	as	long	as	possible,	fighting	sleep	and	forgetting	about
the	rest	of	the	world.


**Cooper**

**Tuesday,	October	16,	5:45	p.m.**

“Pass	the	milk,	would	you,	Cooperstown?”	Pop	jerks	his	chin	at	me
during	dinner,	his	eyes	drifting	toward	the	muted	television	in	our
living	room,	where	college	football	scores	scroll	along	the	bottom	of	the
screen.	“So	what’d	you	do	with	your	night	off?”	He	thinks	it’s	hilarious
that	Luis	posed	as	me	after	the	gym	yesterday.

I	hand	over	the	carton	and	picture	myself	answering	his	question
honestly.	 _Hung	out	with	Kris,	the	guy	I’m	in	love	with.	Yeah,	Pop,	I
said	guy.	No,	Pop,	I’m	not	kidding.	He’s	a	premed	freshman	at	UCSD
who	does	modeling	on	the	side.	Total	catch.	You’d	like	him._

And	then	Pop’s	head	explodes.	That’s	how	it	always	ends	in	my
imagination.

“Just	drove	around	for	a	while,”	I	say	instead.
I’m	not	ashamed	of	Kris.	I’m	 _not._ 	But	it’s	complicated.
Thing	is,	I	didn’t	realize	I	could	feel	that	way	about	a	guy	till	I	met
him.	I	mean,	yeah,	I	 _suspected._ 	Since	I	was	eleven	or	so.	But	I	buried
those	thoughts	as	far	down	as	I	could	because	I’m	a	Southern	jock
shooting	for	an	MLB	career	and	that’s	not	how	we’re	supposed	to	be
wired.

I	really	did	believe	that	for	most	of	my	life.	I’ve	always	had	a
girlfriend.	But	it	was	never	hard	to	hold	off	till	marriage	like	I	was
raised.	I	only	recently	understood	that	was	more	of	an	excuse	than	a
deeply	held	moral	belief.

I’ve	been	lying	to	Keely	for	months,	but	I	did	tell	her	the	truth
about	Kris.	I	met	him	through	baseball,	although	he	doesn’t	play.	He’s
friends	 with	 another	 guy	 I	 made	 the	 exhibition	 rounds	 with,	 who
invited	us	both	to	his	birthday	party.	And	he	 _is_ 	German.

```
I	just	left	out	the	part	about	being	in	love	with	him.
```

I	 can’t	 admit	 that	 to	 anybody	 yet.	 That	 it’s	 not	 a	 phase,	 or
experimentation,	or	distraction	from	pressure.	Nonny	was	right.	My
stomach	does	flips	when	Kris	calls	or	texts	me.	Every	single	time.	And
when	I’m	with	him	I	feel	like	a	real	person,	not	the	robot	Keely	called
me:	programmed	to	perform	as	expected.

But	Cooper-and-Kris	only	exists	in	the	bubble	of	his	apartment.
Moving	it	anyplace	else	scares	the	hell	out	of	me.	For	one	thing,	it’s
hard	 enough	 making	 it	 in	 baseball	 when	 you’re	 a	 regular	 guy.	 The
number	of	openly	gay	players	who	are	part	of	a	major	league	team
stands	at	exactly	one.	And	he’s	still	in	the	minors.

For	another	thing:	Pop.	My	whole	brain	seizes	when	I	imagine	his
reaction.	He’s	the	kind	of	good	old	boy	who	calls	gay	people	“fags”	and
thinks	we	spend	all	our	time	hitting	on	straight	guys.	The	one	time	we
saw	a	news	story	about	the	gay	baseball	player,	he	snorted	in	disgust
and	said,	 _Normal	guys	shouldn’t	have	to	deal	with	that	crap	in	the
locker	room._

If	 I	 tell	 him	 about	 Kris	 and	 me,	 seventeen	 years	 of	 being	 the
perfect	son	would	be	gone	in	an	instant.	He’d	never	look	at	me	the
same.	The	way	he’s	looking	at	me	now,	even	though	I’m	a	murder
suspect	who’s	been	accused	of	using	steroids.	 _That_ 	he	can	handle.

“Testing	 tomorrow,”	 he	 reminds	 me.	 I	 have	 to	 get	 tested	 for
steroids	every	damn	week	now.	In	the	meantime	I	keep	pitching,	and
no,	my	fastball	hasn’t	gotten	any	slower.	Because	I	haven’t	been	lying.	I
didn’t	cheat.	I	strategically	improved.

It	was	Pop’s	idea.	He	wanted	me	to	hold	back	a	little	junior	year,
not	 give	 my	 all,	 so	 there’d	 be	 more	 excitement	 around	 me	 during
showcase	season.	And	there	was.	People	like	Josh	Langley	noticed	me.
But	now,	of	course,	it	looks	suspicious.	 _Thanks,	Pop_.

At	least	he	feels	guilty	about	it.
I	was	sure,	when	the	police	got	ready	to	show	me	the	unpublished
About	That	posts	last	month,	that	I	was	going	to	read	something	about
Kris	and	me.	I’d	barely	known	Simon,	only	talked	with	him	one-on-one
a	few	times.	But	anytime	I	got	near	him	I’d	worry	about	him	learning
my	secret.	Last	spring	at	junior	prom	he’d	been	drunk	off	his	ass,	and
when	I	ran	into	him	in	the	bathroom	he	flung	an	arm	around	me	and
pulled	me	so	close	I	practically	had	a	panic	attack.	I	was	sure	that
Simon—who’d	never	had	a	girlfriend	as	far	as	I	knew—realized	I	was


gay	and	was	putting	the	moves	on	me.

I	freaked	out	so	bad,	I	had	Vanessa	disinvite	him	to	her	after-prom
party.	 And	 Vanessa,	 who	 never	 passes	 up	 a	 chance	 to	 exclude
somebody,	was	happy	to	do	it.	I	let	it	stand	even	after	I	saw	Simon
hitting	on	Keely	later	with	the	kind	of	intensity	you	can’t	fake.

I	hadn’t	let	myself	think	about	that	since	Simon	died;	how	the	last
time	I’d	talked	to	him,	I	acted	like	a	jerk	because	I	couldn’t	deal	with
who	I	was.

```
And	the	worst	part	is,	even	after	all	this—I	still	can’t.

**Tuesday,	October	16,	6:00	p.m.**

When	I	get	to	Glenn’s	Diner	half	an	hour	after	I’m	supposed	to	meet
my	mother,	her	Kia	is	parked	right	out	front.	Score	one	for	the	new	and
improved	version,	I	guess.	I	wouldn’t	have	been	at	all	surprised	if	she
didn’t	show.

I	thought	about	doing	the	same.	A	lot.	But	pretending	she	doesn’t
exist	hasn’t	worked	out	all	that	well.

I	park	my	bike	a	few	spaces	away	from	her	car,	feeling	the	first
drops	 of	 rain	 hit	 my	 shoulders	 before	 I	 enter	 the	 restaurant.	 The
hostess	 looks	 up	 with	 a	 polite,	 quizzical	 expression.	 “I’m	 meeting
somebody.	Macauley,”	I	say.

She	nods	and	points	to	a	corner	booth.	“Right	over	there.”
I	can	tell	my	mother’s	already	been	there	for	a	while.	Her	soda’s
almost	empty	and	she’s	torn	her	straw	wrapper	to	shreds.	When	I	slide
into	the	seat	across	from	her,	I	pick	up	a	menu	and	scan	it	carefully	to
avoid	her	eyes.	“You	order?”

“Oh,	no.	I	was	waiting	for	you.”	I	can	practically	feel	her	willing
me	 to	 look	 up.	 I	 wish	 I	 weren’t	 here.	 “Do	 you	 want	 a	 hamburger,
Nathaniel?	You	used	to	love	Glenn’s	hamburgers.”

I	did,	and	I	do,	but	now	I	want	to	order	anything	else.	“It’s	Nate,
okay?”	I	snap	my	menu	shut	and	stare	at	the	gray	drizzle	pelting	the
window.	“Nobody	calls	me	that	anymore.”

“Nate,”	she	says,	but	my	name	sounds	strange	coming	from	her.
One	of	those	words	you	say	over	and	over	until	it	loses	meaning.	A
waitress	comes	by	and	I	order	a	Coke	and	a	club	sandwich	I	don’t	want.


My	burner	phone	buzzes	in	my	pocket	and	I	pull	it	out	to	a	text	from
Bronwyn.	 _Hope	it’s	going	ok._ 	I	feel	a	jolt	of	warmth,	but	put	the	phone
back	without	answering.	I	don’t	have	the	words	to	tell	Bronwyn	what
it’s	like	to	have	lunch	with	a	ghost.

“Nate.”	 My	 mother	 clears	 her	 throat	 around	 my	 name.	 It	 still
sounds	wrong.	“How	is...How	are	you	doing	in	school?	Do	you	still	like
science?”

Christ.	 _Do	you	still	like	science?_ 	I’ve	been	in	remedial	classes	since
ninth	grade,	but	how	would	she	know?	Progress	reports	come	home,	I
fake	my	father’s	signature,	and	they	go	back.	Nobody	ever	questions
them.	“Can	you	pay	for	this?”	I	ask,	gesturing	around	the	table.	Like
the	 belligerent	 asshole	 I’ve	 turned	 into	 in	 the	 past	 five	 minutes.
“Because	I	can’t.	So	if	you’re	expecting	that	you	should	tell	me	before
the	food	comes.”

Her	face	sags,	and	I	feel	a	pointless	stab	of	triumph.	“Nath—Nate.
I	 would	 never...well.	 Why	 should	 you	 believe	 me?”	 She	 pulls	 out	 a
wallet	and	puts	a	couple	of	twenties	on	the	table,	and	I	feel	like	shit
until	I	think	about	the	bills	I	keep	tossing	into	the	trash	instead	of
paying.	Now	that	I’m	not	earning	anything,	my	father’s	disability	check
barely	covers	the	mortgage,	utilities,	and	his	alcohol.

“How	do	you	have	money	when	you’ve	been	in	rehab	for	months?”
The	waitress	returns	with	a	glass	of	Coke	for	me,	and	my	mother
waits	until	she	leaves	to	answer.	“One	of	the	doctors	at	Pine	Valley—
that’s	 the	 facility	 I’ve	 been	 in—connected	 me	 with	 a	 medical
transcription	company.	I	can	work	anywhere,	and	it’s	very	steady.”	She
brushes	her	hand	against	mine	and	I	jerk	away.	“I	can	help	you	and
your	father	out,	Nate.	I	will.	I	wanted	to	ask	you—if	you	have	a	lawyer,
for	the	investigation?	We	could	look	into	that.”

Somehow,	I	manage	not	to	laugh.	Whatever	she’s	making,	it’s	not
enough	to	pay	a	lawyer.	“I’m	good.”

She	keeps	trying,	asking	about	school,	Simon,	probation,	my	dad.
It	almost	gets	to	me,	because	she’s	different	than	I	remember.	Calmer
and	 more	 even-tempered.	 But	 then	 she	 asks,	 “How’s	 Bronwyn
handling	all	this?”

_Nope._ 	Every	time	I	think	about	Bronwyn	my	body	reacts	like	I’m
back	on	the	couch	in	her	media	room—heart	pounding,	blood	rushing,
skin	tingling.	I’m	not	about	to	turn	the	one	good	thing	that’s	come	out


of	this	mess	into	yet	another	awkward	conversation	with	my	mother.
Which	means	we’ve	pretty	much	run	out	of	things	to	say.	Thank	God
the	food’s	arrived	so	we	can	stop	trying	to	pretend	the	last	three	years
never	happened.	Even	though	my	sandwich	tastes	like	nothing,	like
dust,	it’s	better	than	that.

My	mother	doesn’t	take	the	hint.	She	keeps	bringing	up	Oregon
and	her	doctors	and	 _Mikhail	Powers	Investigates_ 	until	I	feel	as	if	I’m
about	to	choke.	I	pull	at	the	neck	of	my	T-shirt	like	that’ll	help	me
breathe,	but	it	doesn’t.	I	can’t	sit	here	listening	to	her	promises	and
hoping	it’ll	all	work	out.	That	she’ll	stay	sober,	stay	employed,	stay
sane.	Just	stay.

“I	have	to	go,”	I	say	abruptly,	dropping	my	half-eaten	sandwich
onto	my	plate.	I	get	up,	banging	my	knee	against	the	edge	of	the	table
so	hard	I	wince,	and	walk	out	without	looking	at	her.	I	know	she	won’t
come	after	me.	That’s	not	how	she	operates.

When	I	get	outside	I’m	confused	at	first	because	I	can’t	see	my
bike.	It’s	wedged	between	a	couple	of	huge	Range	Rovers	that	weren’t
there	before.	I	make	my	way	toward	it,	then	suddenly	a	guy	who’s	way
overdressed	for	Glenn’s	Diner	steps	in	front	of	me	with	a	blinding
smile.	I	recognize	him	right	away	but	look	through	him	as	if	I	don’t.

“Nate	Macauley?	Mikhail	Powers.	You’re	a	hard	man	to	find,	you
know	that?	Thrilled	to	make	your	acquaintance.	We’re	working	on	our
follow-up	broadcast	to	the	Simon	Kelleher	investigation	and	I’d	love
your	take.	How	about	I	buy	you	a	coffee	inside	and	we	talk	for	a	few
minutes?”

I	climb	onto	my	bike	and	strap	on	my	helmet	like	I	didn’t	hear
him.	I	get	ready	to	back	up,	but	a	couple	of	producer	types	block	my
way.	“How	about	you	tell	your	people	to	move?”

His	smile’s	as	wide	as	ever.	“I’m	not	your	enemy,	Nate.	The	court
of	public	opinion	matters	in	a	case	like	this.	What	do	you	say	we	get
them	on	your	side?”

My	mother	appears	in	the	parking	lot,	her	mouth	falling	open
when	she	sees	who’s	next	to	me.	I	slowly	reverse	my	bike	until	the
people	in	my	way	move	and	I’ve	got	a	clear	path.	If	she	wants	to	help
me,	she	can	talk	to	him.


**Bronwyn**

**Wednesday,	October	17,	12:25	p.m.**

At	lunch	on	Wednesday,	Addy	and	I	are	talking	about	nail	polish.	She’s
a	font	of	information	on	the	subject.	“With	short	nails	like	yours,	you
want	something	pale,	almost	nude,”	she	says,	examining	my	hands
with	a	professional	air.	“But,	like,	super	glossy.”

“I	don’t	really	wear	nail	polish,”	I	tell	her.
“Well,	you’re	getting	fancier,	aren’t	you?	For	 _whatever	reason._ ”
She	 arches	 a	 brow	 at	 my	 careful	 blow-dry,	 and	 my	 cheeks	 heat	 as
Maeve	laughs.	“You	might	want	to	give	it	a	try.”

It’s	a	mundane,	innocuous	conversation	compared	to	yesterday’s
lunch,	when	we	caught	up	on	my	police	visit,	Nate’s	mother,	and	the
fact	that	Addy	got	called	to	the	station	separately	to	answer	questions
about	the	missing	EpiPens	again.	Yesterday	we	were	murder	suspects
with	complicated	personal	lives,	but	today	we’re	just	being	girls.

Until	a	shrill	voice	from	a	few	tables	over	pierces	the	conversation.
“It’s	like	I	told	them,”	Vanessa	Merriman	says.	“Which	person’s	rumor
is	 _definitely_ 	true?	And	which	person’s	totally	fallen	apart	since	Simon
died?	That’s	your	murderer.”

“What’s	she	on	about	now?”	Addy	mutters,	nibbling	like	a	squirrel
at	an	oversized	crouton.

Janae,	who	doesn’t	talk	much	when	she	sits	with	us,	darts	a	look	at
Addy	and	says,	“You	haven’t	heard?	Mikhail	Powers’s	crew	is	out	front.
A	bunch	of	kids	are	giving	interviews.”

My	stomach	drops,	and	Addy	shoves	her	tray	away.	“Oh,	great.
That’s	all	I	need,	Vanessa	on	TV	yakking	about	how	guilty	I	am.”

“Nobody	really	thinks	it	was	you,”	Janae	says.	She	nods	toward
me.	“Or	you.	Or...”	She	watches	as	Cooper	heads	for	Vanessa’s	table
with	a	tray	balanced	in	one	hand,	then	spots	us	and	changes	course,


seating	himself	at	the	edge	of	ours.	He	does	that	sometimes;	sits	with
Addy	for	a	few	minutes	at	the	beginning	of	lunch.	Long	enough	to
signal	he’s	not	abandoning	her	like	the	rest	of	her	friends,	but	not	so
long	 that	 Jake	 gets	 pissed.	 I	 can’t	 decide	 whether	 it’s	 sweet	 or
cowardly.

“What’s	 up,	 guys?”	 he	 asks,	 starting	 to	 peel	 an	 orange.	 He’s
dressed	in	a	sage	button-down	that	brightens	his	hazel	eyes,	and	he’s
got	 a	 baseball-cap	 tan	 from	 the	 sun	 hitting	 his	 cheeks	 more	 than
anything	else.	Somehow,	instead	of	making	him	look	uneven,	it	only
adds	to	the	Cooper	Clay	glow.

I	used	to	think	Cooper	was	the	handsomest	guy	at	school.	He	still
might	be,	but	lately	there’s	something	almost	Ken	doll–like	about	him
—a	little	plastic	and	conventional.	Or	maybe	my	tastes	have	changed.
“Have	you	given	your	Mikhail	Powers	interview	yet?”	I	joke.

Before	 he	 can	 answer,	 a	 voice	 speaks	 over	 my	 shoulder.	 “You
should.	Go	ahead	and	be	the	murder	club	everybody	thinks	you	guys
are.	Ridding	Bayview	High	of	its	asshats.”	Leah	Jackson	perches	on	the
table	next	to	Cooper.	She	doesn’t	notice	Janae,	who	turns	brick	red	and
stiffens	in	her	chair.

“Hello,	 Leah,”	 Cooper	 says	 patiently.	 As	 though	 he’s	 heard	 it
before.	Which	I	guess	he	did,	at	Simon’s	memorial	service.

Leah	scans	the	table,	her	eyes	landing	on	me.	“You	ever	gonna
admit	you	cheated?”	Her	tone’s	conversational	and	her	expression	is
almost	friendly,	but	I	still	freeze.

“Hypocritical,	 Leah.”	 Maeve’s	 voice	 rings	 out,	 surprising	 me.
When	I	turn,	her	eyes	are	blazing.	“You	can’t	complain	about	Simon	in
one	breath	and	repeat	his	rumor	in	the	next.”

Leah	gives	Maeve	a	small	salute.	“Touché,	Rojas	the	younger.”
But	Maeve’s	just	getting	warmed	up.	“I’m	sick	of	the	conversation
never	 changing.	 Why	 doesn’t	 anybody	 talk	 about	 how	 awful	 About
That	made	this	school	sometimes?”	She	looks	directly	at	Leah,	her	eyes
challenging.	“Why	don’t	 _you_ ?	They’re	right	outside,	you	know.	Dying
for	a	new	angle.	You	could	give	it	to	them.”

Leah	recoils.	“I’m	not	talking	to	the	media	about	that.”
“Why	not?”	Maeve	asks.	I’ve	never	seen	her	like	this;	she’s	almost
fierce	as	she	stares	Leah	down.	“You	didn’t	do	anything	wrong.	Simon


did.	He	did	it	for	years,	and	now	everybody’s	sainting	him	for	it.	Don’t
you	have	a	problem	with	that?”

Leah	stares	right	back,	and	I	can’t	make	out	the	expression	that
crosses	her	face.	It’s	almost...triumphant?	“Obviously	I	do.”

“So	do	something	about	it,”	Maeve	says.
Leah	stands	abruptly,	pushing	her	hair	over	her	shoulder.	The
movement	lifts	her	sleeve	and	exposes	a	crescent-shaped	scar	on	her
wrist.	“Maybe	I	will.”	She	stalks	out	the	door	with	long	strides.

Cooper	blinks	after	her.	“Dang,	Maeve.	Remind	me	not	to	get	on
your	bad	side.”	Maeve	wrinkles	her	nose,	and	I	remember	the	file	with
Cooper’s	name	on	it	she	still	hasn’t	managed	to	decrypt.

“ _Leah’s_ 	not	on	my	bad	side,”	she	mutters,	tapping	furiously	on	her
phone.

I’m	almost	afraid	to	ask.	“What	are	you	doing?”
“Sending	Simon’s	4chan	threads	to	 _Mikhail	Powers	Investigates,_ ”
she	says.	“They’re	journalists,	right?	They	should	look	into	it.”

“What?”	Janae	bursts	out.	“What	are	you	talking	about?”
“Simon	was	all	over	these	discussion	threads	full	of	creepy	people
cheering	on	school	shootings	and	stuff	like	that,”	Maeve	says.	“I’ve
been	reading	them	for	days.	Other	people	started	them,	but	he	jumped
right	in	and	said	all	kinds	of	awful	things.	He	didn’t	even	care	when
that	boy	killed	all	those	people	in	Orange	County.”	She’s	still	tapping
away	when	Janae’s	hand	shoots	out	and	locks	around	her	wrist,	almost
knocking	her	phone	from	her	hand.

“How	would	you	know	that?”	she	hisses,	and	Maeve	finally	snaps
out	of	the	zone	to	realize	she	might’ve	said	too	much.

“Let	her	go,”	I	say.	When	Janae	doesn’t,	I	reach	out	and	pry	her
fingers	off	Maeve’s	wrist.	They’re	icy	cold.	Janae	pushes	her	chair	back
with	a	loud	scrape,	and	when	she	gets	to	her	feet	she’s	shaking	all	over.

“None	of	you	knew	anything	about	him,”	she	says	in	a	choked
voice,	and	stomps	away	just	like	Leah	did.	Except	she’s	probably	not
about	 to	 give	 Mikhail	 Powers	 a	 sound	 bite.	 Maeve	 and	 I	 exchange
glances	as	I	drum	my	fingers	on	the	table.	I	can’t	figure	Janae	out.
Most	 days,	 I’m	 not	 sure	 why	 she	 sits	 with	 us	 when	 we	 must	 be	 a
constant	reminder	of	Simon.


Unless	it’s	to	hear	conversations	like	the	one	we	just	had.
“I	 gotta	 go,”	 Cooper	 says	 abruptly,	 as	 though	 he’s	 used	 up	 his
allotted	non-Jake	time.	He	lifts	his	tray,	where	the	bulk	of	his	lunch
lies	untouched,	and	smoothly	makes	his	way	to	his	usual	table.

So	our	crew	is	back	to	being	all	girls,	and	stays	that	way	for	the
rest	 of	 lunch.	 The	 only	 other	 guy	 who’d	 sit	 with	 us	 never	 bothers
making	an	appearance	in	the	cafeteria.	But	I	pass	Nate	in	the	hallway
afterward,	and	all	the	questions	bubbling	in	my	brain	about	Simon,
Leah,	and	Janae	disappear	when	he	gives	me	a	fleeting	grin.

```
Because	God,	it’s	beautiful	when	that	boy	smiles.

**Addy**

**Friday,	October	19,	11:12	a.m.**

It’s	hot	on	the	track,	and	I	shouldn’t	feel	like	running	very	hard.	It’s
only	gym	class,	after	all.	But	my	arms	and	legs	pump	with	unexpected
energy	as	my	lungs	fill	and	expand,	as	if	all	my	recent	bike	riding	has
given	me	reserves	that	need	a	release.	Sweat	beads	my	forehead	and
pastes	my	T-shirt	to	my	back.

I	feel	a	jolt	of	pride	as	I	pass	Luis—who,	granted,	is	barely	trying—
and	Olivia,	who’s	on	the	track	team.	Jake’s	ahead	of	me	and	the	idea	of
catching	him	seems	ridiculous	because	obviously	Jake	is	much	faster
than	me,	and	bigger	and	stronger	too,	and	there’s	no	way	I	can	gain	on
him	except	I	am.	He’s	not	a	speck	anymore;	he’s	close,	and	if	I	shift
lanes	and	keep	this	pace	going	I	can	almost,	probably,	definitely—

My	legs	fly	out	from	under	me.	The	coppery	taste	of	blood	fills	my
mouth	 as	 I	 bite	 into	 my	 lip	 and	 my	 palms	 slam	 hard	 against	 the
ground.	 Tiny	 stones	 shred	 my	 skin,	 embedding	 in	 raw	 flesh	 and
exploding	into	dozens	of	tiny	cuts.	My	knees	are	in	agony	and	I	know
before	I	see	thick	red	dots	on	the	ground	that	my	skin’s	burst	open	on
both	of	them.

“Oh	no!”	Vanessa’s	voice	rings	with	fake	concern.	“Poor	thing!	Her
legs	gave	out.”

They	didn’t.	While	my	eyes	were	on	Jake,	someone’s	foot	hooked
my	ankle	and	brought	me	down.	I	have	a	pretty	good	idea	whose,	but
can’t	say	anything	because	I’m	too	busy	trying	to	suck	air	into	my
lungs.

```
“Addy,	are	you	okay?”	Vanessa	keeps	her	fake	voice	on	as	she
```

kneels	 next	 to	 me,	 until	 she’s	 right	 next	 to	 my	 ear	 and	 whispers,
“Serves	you	right,	slut.”

I’d	love	to	answer	her,	but	I	still	can’t	breathe.
When	our	gym	teacher	arrives	Vanessa	backs	off,	and	by	the	time	I
have	enough	air	to	talk	she’s	gone.	The	gym	teacher	inspects	my	knees,
turns	 my	 hands	 over,	 clucks	 at	 the	 damage.	 “You	 need	 the	 nurse’s
office.	Get	those	cuts	cleaned	up	and	some	antibiotics	on	you.”	She
scans	the	crowd	that’s	gathered	around	me	and	calls,	“Miss	Vargas!
Help	her	out.”

I	guess	I	should	be	grateful	it’s	not	Vanessa	or	Jake.	But	I’ve	barely
seen	Janae	since	Bronwyn’s	sister	called	Simon	out	a	couple	of	days
ago.	 As	 I	 limp	 toward	 school	 Janae	 doesn’t	 look	 at	 me	 until	 we’re
almost	at	the	entrance.	“What	happened?”	she	asks	as	she	opens	the
door.

By	now	I	have	enough	breath	to	laugh.	“Vanessa’s	version	of	slut-
shaming.”	I	turn	left	instead	of	right	at	the	stairwell,	heading	for	the
locker	room.

“You’re	supposed	to	go	to	the	nurse’s,”	Janae	says,	and	I	flutter	my
hand	at	her.	I	haven’t	darkened	the	nurse’s	doorstep	in	weeks,	and
anyway,	 my	 cuts	 are	 painful	 but	 superficial.	 All	 I	 really	 need	 is	 a
shower.	I	limp	to	a	stall	and	peel	off	my	clothes,	stepping	under	the
warm	spray	and	watching	brown-and-red	water	swirl	down	the	drain.	I
stay	in	the	shower	until	the	water’s	clear	and	when	I	step	out,	a	towel
wrapped	around	me,	Janae’s	there	holding	a	pack	of	Band-Aids.

“I	got	these	for	you.	Your	knees	need	them.”
“Thanks.”	 I	 lower	 myself	 onto	 a	 bench	 and	 press	 flesh-colored
strips	across	my	knees,	which	sure	enough	are	getting	slick	with	blood
again.	My	palms	sting	and	they’re	scraped	pink	and	raw,	but	there’s
nowhere	I	can	put	a	Band-Aid	that	will	make	a	difference.

Janae	sits	as	far	away	as	possible	from	me	on	the	bench.	I	put
three	Band-Aids	on	my	left	knee	and	two	on	my	right.	“Vanessa’s	a
bitch,”	she	says	quietly.

“Yeah,”	I	agree,	standing	and	taking	a	cautious	step.	My	legs	hold
up,	so	I	head	for	my	locker	and	pull	out	my	clothes.	“But	I’m	getting
what	I	deserve,	right?	That’s	what	everybody	thinks.	I	guess	it’s	what
Simon	 would’ve	 wanted.	 Everything	 out	 in	 the	 open	 for	 people	 to


judge.	No	secrets.”

“Simon...”	 Janae’s	 got	 that	 strangled	 sound	 to	 her	 voice	 again.
“He’s	not...He	wasn’t	like	they	said.	I	mean,	yes,	he	went	overboard
with	About	That,	and	he	wrote	some	awful	things.	But	the	past	couple
years	have	been	rough.	He	tried	so	hard	to	be	part	of	things	and	he
never	 could.	 I	 don’t	 think...”	 She	 stumbles	 over	 her	 words.	 “When
Simon	was	himself,	he	wouldn’t	have	wanted	this	for	you.”

She	sounds	really	sad	about	it.	But	I	can’t	bring	myself	to	care
about	Simon	now.	I	finish	dressing	and	look	at	the	clock.	There’s	still
twenty	minutes	left	in	gym	class,	and	I	don’t	want	to	be	here	when
Vanessa	and	her	minions	descend.	“Thanks	for	the	Band-Aids.	Tell
them	I’m	still	at	the	nurse’s,	okay?	I’m	going	to	the	library	till	next
period.”

“Okay,”	Janae	says.	She’s	slumped	on	the	bench,	looking	hollowed
out	and	exhausted,	and	as	I	head	for	the	door	she	abruptly	calls	out,
“Do	you	want	to	hang	out	this	afternoon?”

I	turn	to	her	in	surprise.	I	hadn’t	thought	we	were	at	that	point	in
our...acquaintance,	I	guess.	 _Friendship_ 	still	seems	like	a	strong	word.
“Um,	yeah.	Sure.”

“My	mom’s	having	her	book	club,	so...maybe	I	could	come	to	your
house?”

“All	right,”	I	say,	picturing	my	own	mother’s	reaction	to	Janae
after	being	used	to	a	house	full	of	pretty-perky	Keelys	and	Olivias.	The
thought	brightens	me	up,	and	we	make	plans	for	Janae	to	stop	by	after
school.	On	a	whim	I	text	an	invitation	to	Bronwyn,	but	I	forgot	she’s
grounded.	Plus,	she	has	piano	lessons.	Spontaneous	downtime	isn’t
really	her	thing.

```
—
```
I’ve	barely	stowed	my	bike	under	the	porch	after	school	when	Janae
arrives	dragging	her	oversized	backpack	like	she	came	to	study.	We
make	excruciating	small	talk	with	my	mother,	whose	eyes	keep	roving
from	Janae’s	multiple	piercings	to	her	scuffed	combat	boots,	until	I
bring	her	upstairs	to	watch	TV.

“Do	you	like	that	new	Netflix	show?”	I	ask,	aiming	the	remote	at
my	 television	 and	 sprawling	 across	 my	 bed	 so	 Janae	 can	 take	 the
armchair.	“The	superhero	one?”


She	sits	gingerly,	like	she’s	afraid	the	pink	plaid	will	swallow	her
whole.	“Yeah,	okay,”	she	says,	lowering	her	backpack	next	to	her	and
looking	at	all	the	framed	photographs	on	my	wall.	“You’re	really	into
flowers,	huh?”

“Not	exactly.	My	sister	has	a	new	camera	I	was	playing	around
with,	and...I	took	a	lot	of	old	pictures	down	recently.”	They’re	shoved
beneath	my	shoe	boxes	now:	a	dozen	memories	of	me	and	Jake	from
the	past	three	years,	and	almost	as	many	with	my	friends.	I	hesitated
over	one—me,	Keely,	Olivia,	and	Vanessa	at	the	beach	last	summer,
wearing	giant	sun	hats	and	goofy	grins	with	a	brilliant	blue	sky	behind
us.	It	had	been	a	rare,	fun	girls’	day	out,	but	after	today	I’m	more	glad
than	ever	that	I	banished	Vanessa’s	stupid	smirk	to	the	closet.

Janae	fiddles	with	the	strap	to	her	backpack.	“You	must	miss	how
things	were	before,”	she	says	in	a	low	voice.

I	 keep	 my	 eyes	 trained	 on	 the	 screen	 while	 I	 consider	 her
comment.	“Yes	and	no,”	I	say	finally.	“I	miss	how	easy	school	used	to
be.	But	I	guess	nobody	I	hung	out	with	ever	really	cared	about	me,
right?	Or	things	would	have	been	different.”	I	shift	restlessly	on	the
bed	and	add,	“I’m	not	gonna	pretend	it’s	anything	like	what	you’re
dealing	with.	Losing	Simon	that	way.”

Janae	flushes	and	doesn’t	answer,	and	I	wish	I	hadn’t	brought	it
up.	I	can’t	figure	out	how	to	interact	with	her.	Are	we	friends,	or	just	a
couple	 of	 people	 without	 better	 options?	 We	 stare	 silently	 at	 the
television	 until	 Janae	 clears	 her	 throat	 and	 says,	 “Could	 I	 have
something	to	drink?”

“Sure.”	 It’s	 almost	 a	 relief	 to	 escape	 the	 silence	 that’s	 settled
between	us,	until	I	run	into	my	mother	in	the	kitchen	and	have	a	terse,
ten-minute-long	conversation	about	 _the	kind	of	friends	you	have	now._
When	I	finally	get	back	upstairs,	two	glasses	of	lemonade	in	hand,
Janae’s	got	her	backpack	on	and	she’s	halfway	out	the	door.

“I	don’t	feel	well	suddenly,”	she	mumbles.
Great.	Even	my	unsuitable	friends	don’t	want	to	hang	out	with	me.
I	text	Bronwyn	in	frustration,	not	expecting	an	answer	since	she’s
probably	in	the	middle	of	Chopin	or	something.	I’m	surprised	when
she	messages	me	back	right	away,	and	even	more	surprised	at	what	she
writes.


_Be	careful.	I	don’t	trust	her._


**Cooper**

**Sunday,	October	21,	5:25	p.m.**

We’ve	almost	finished	dinner	when	Pop’s	phone	rings.	He	looks	at	the
number	 and	 picks	 up	 immediately,	 the	 lines	 around	 his	 mouth
deepening.	 “This	 is	 Kevin.	 Yeah.	 What,	 tonight?	 Is	 that	 really
necessary?”	He	waits	a	beat.	“All	right.	We’ll	see	you	there.”	He	hangs
up	and	blows	out	an	irritated	sigh.	“We	gotta	meet	your	lawyer	at	the
police	station	in	half	an	hour.	Detective	Chang	wants	to	talk	to	you
again.”	He	holds	up	a	hand	when	I	open	my	mouth.	“I	don’t	know	what
about.”

I	swallow	hard.	I	haven’t	been	questioned	in	a	while,	and	I’d	been
hoping	the	whole	thing	was	fading	away.	I	want	to	text	Addy	and	see	if
she’s	getting	brought	in	too,	but	I’m	under	strict	orders	not	to	put
anything	about	the	investigation	in	writing.	Calling	Addy’s	not	a	great
idea,	either.	So	I	finish	my	dinner	in	silence	and	drive	to	the	station
with	Pop.

My	lawyer,	Mary,	is	already	talking	with	Detective	Chang	when	we
get	 inside.	 He	 beckons	 us	 toward	 the	 interrogation	 room,	 which	 is
nothing	like	you	see	on	TV.	No	big	pane	of	glass	with	a	two-way	mirror
behind	it.	Just	a	drab	little	room	with	a	conference	table	and	a	bunch
of	folding	chairs.	“Hello,	Cooper.	Mr.	Clay.	Thanks	for	coming.”	I’m
about	to	brush	past	him	through	the	door	when	he	puts	a	hand	on	my
arm.	“You	sure	you	want	your	father	here?”

I’m	about	to	ask	 _Why	wouldn’t	I?_ 	but	before	I	can	speak,	Pop
starts	 blustering	 about	 how	 it’s	 his	 God-given	 right	 to	 be	 present
during	questioning.	He	has	this	speech	perfected	and	once	he	winds
up,	he	needs	to	finish.

“Of	course,”	Detective	Chang	says	politely.	“It’s	mainly	a	privacy
issue	for	Cooper.”

```
The	way	he	says	that	makes	me	nervous,	and	I	look	to	Mary	for
```

help.	“It	should	be	fine	to	start	with	just	me	in	the	room,	Kevin,”	she
says.	“I’ll	bring	you	in	if	needed.”	Mary’s	okay.	She’s	in	her	fifties,	no-
nonsense,	and	can	handle	both	the	police	and	my	father.	So	in	the	end
it’s	me,	Detective	Chang,	and	Mary	seating	ourselves	around	the	table.

My	heart’s	already	pounding	when	Detective	Chang	pulls	out	a
laptop.	“You’ve	always	been	vocal	about	Simon’s	accusation	not	being
true,	Cooper.	And	there’s	been	no	drop	in	your	baseball	performance.
Which	is	inconsistent	with	the	reputation	of	Simon’s	app.	It	wasn’t
known	for	posting	lies.”

I	 try	 to	 keep	 my	 expression	 neutral,	 even	 though	 I’ve	 been
thinking	the	same	thing.	I	was	more	relieved	than	mad	when	Detective
Chang	first	showed	me	Simon’s	site,	because	a	lie	was	better	than	the
truth.	But	why	would	Simon	lie	about	me?

“So	we	dug	a	little	deeper.	Turns	out	we	missed	something	in	our
initial	analysis	of	Simon’s	files.	There	was	a	second	entry	for	you	that
was	 encrypted	 and	 replaced	 with	 the	 steroids	 accusation.	 It	 took	 a
while	to	get	that	file	figured	out,	but	the	original	is	here.”	He	turns	the
screen	so	it’s	facing	Mary	and	me.	We	lean	forward	together	to	read	it.

```
Everybody	wants	a	piece	of	Bayview	southpaw	CC	and	he’s	finally	been
tempted.	He’s	stepping	out	on	the	beauteous	KS	with	a	hot	German	underwear
model.	What	guy	wouldn’t,	right?	Except	the	new	love	interest	models	boxers
and	briefs,	not	bras	and	thongs.	Sorry,	K,	but	you	can’t	compete	when	you	play
for	the	wrong	team.
```
Every	part	of	me	feels	frozen	except	my	eyes,	which	can’t	stop
blinking.	This	is	what	I	was	afraid	I’d	see	weeks	ago.

“Cooper.”	Mary’s	voice	is	even.	“There’s	no	need	to	react	to	this.
Do	you	have	a	question,	Detective	Chang?”

“Yes.	Is	the	rumor	Simon	planned	to	print	true,	Cooper?”
Mary	 speaks	 before	 I	 can.	 “There’s	 nothing	 criminal	 in	 this
accusation.	Cooper	doesn’t	need	to	address	it.”

“Mary,	 you	 know	 that’s	 not	 the	 case.	 We	 have	 an	 interesting
situation	here.	Four	students	with	four	entries	they	want	to	keep	quiet.
One	gets	deleted	and	replaced	with	a	fake.	Do	you	know	what	that
looks	like?”

```
“Shoddy	rumormongering?”	Mary	asks.
“Like	someone	accessed	Simon’s	files	to	get	rid	of	this	particular
```

entry.	And	made	sure	Simon	wouldn’t	be	around	to	correct	it.”

“I	need	a	few	minutes	with	my	client,”	Mary	says.
I	 feel	 sick.	 I’ve	 imagined	 breaking	 the	 news	 about	 Kris	 to	 my
parents	in	dozens	of	ways,	but	none	as	flat-out	horrible	as	this.

“Of	 course.	 You	 should	 know	 we’ll	 be	 requesting	 a	 warrant	 to
search	more	of	the	Clays’	home,	beyond	Cooper’s	computer	and	cell
phone	records.	Given	this	new	information,	he’s	a	more	significant
person	of	interest	than	he	was	previously.”

Mary	has	a	hand	on	my	arm.	She	doesn’t	want	me	to	talk.	She
doesn’t	have	to	worry.	I	couldn’t	if	I	tried.

```
—
```
_Disclosing	 information	 about	 sexual	 orientation	 violates
constitutional	 rights	 to	 privacy._ That’s	 what	 Mary	 says,	 and	 she’s
threatened	to	involve	the	American	Civil	Liberties	Union	if	the	police
make	Simon’s	post	about	me	public.	Which	would	fall	into	the	category
of	Too	Little,	Way	Too	Late.

Detective	 Chang	 dances	 around	 it.	 They	 have	 no	 intention	 of
invading	my	privacy.	But	they	have	to	investigate.	It	would	help	if	I
told	them	everything.	Our	definitions	of	 _everything_ 	are	different.	His
includes	me	confessing	that	I	killed	Simon,	deleted	my	About	That
entry,	and	replaced	it	with	a	fake	one	about	steroids.

Which	makes	no	sense.	Wouldn’t	I	have	taken	myself	out	of	the
equation	entirely?	Or	come	up	with	something	less	career-threatening?
Like	cheating	on	Keely	with	another	girl.	That	might’ve	killed	two	birds
with	one	stone,	so	to	speak.

“This	changes	nothing,”	Mary	keeps	saying.	“You	have	no	more
proof	than	you	ever	did	that	Cooper	touched	Simon’s	site.	Don’t	you
dare	disclose	sensitive	information	in	the	name	of	your	 _investigation._ ”

The	thing	is,	though,	it	doesn’t	matter.	It’s	getting	out.	This	case
has	been	full	of	leaks	from	the	beginning.	And	I	can’t	waltz	out	of	here
after	 being	 interrogated	 for	 an	 hour	 and	 tell	 my	 father	 nothing’s
changed.

When	Detective	Chang	leaves,	he	makes	it	clear	they’ll	be	digging
deep	into	my	life	over	the	next	few	days.	They	want	Kris’s	number.
Mary	tells	me	I	don’t	have	to	provide	it,	but	Detective	Chang	reminds


her	they’ll	subpoena	my	cell	phone	and	get	it	anyway.	They	want	to	talk
to	Keely,	too.	Mary	keeps	threatening	the	ACLU,	and	Detective	Chang
keeps	telling	her,	mild	as	skim	milk,	that	they	need	to	understand	my
actions	in	the	weeks	leading	up	to	the	murder.

But	we	all	know	what’s	really	happening.	They’ll	make	my	life
miserable	until	I	cave	from	the	pressure.

I	sit	with	Mary	in	the	interrogation	room	after	Detective	Chang
leaves,	thankful	there’s	no	two-way	mirror	as	I	bury	my	head	in	my
hands.	Life	as	I	knew	it	is	over,	and	pretty	soon	nobody	will	look	at	me
the	 same	 way.	 I	 was	 going	 to	 tell	 eventually,	 but—in	 a	 few	 years,
maybe?	When	I	was	a	star	pitcher	and	untouchable.	Not	now.	Not	like
_this._

“Cooper.”	Mary	puts	a	hand	on	my	shoulder.	“Your	father	will	be
wondering	why	we’re	still	in	here.	You	need	to	talk	to	him.”

“I	can’t,”	I	say	automatically.	 _Cain’t._
“Your	father	loves	you,”	she	says	quietly.
I	almost	laugh.	Pop	loves	 _Cooperstown._ 	He	loves	when	I	strike	out
the	 side	 and	 get	 attention	 from	 flashy	 scouts,	 and	 when	 my	 name
scrolls	across	the	bottom	of	ESPN.	But	me?

He	doesn’t	even	know	me.
There’s	a	knock	on	the	door	before	I	can	reply.	Pop	pokes	his	head
in	and	snaps	his	fingers.	“We	done	in	here?	I	wanna	get	home.”

“All	set,”	I	say.
“The	hell	was	that	all	about?”	he	demands	of	Mary.
“You	and	Cooper	need	to	talk,”	she	says.	Pop’s	jaw	tenses.	 _What
the	hell	are	we	paying	you	for?_ 	is	written	all	over	his	face.	“We	can
discuss	next	steps	after	that.”

“Fantastic,”	Pop	mutters.	I	stand	and	squeeze	myself	through	the
narrow	gap	between	the	table	and	the	wall,	ducking	past	Mary	and	into
the	hallway.	We	walk	in	silence,	one	in	front	of	the	other,	until	we	pass
through	 the	 double	 glass	 doors	 and	 Mary	 murmurs	 a	 good-bye.
“Night,”	Pop	says,	tersely	leading	the	way	to	our	car	at	the	far	end	of
the	parking	lot.

Everything	in	me	clenches	and	twists	as	I	buckle	myself	next	to
him	in	the	Jeep.	How	do	I	start?	What	do	I	say?	Do	I	tell	him	now,	or


wait	till	we’re	home	and	I	can	tell	Mom	and	Nonny	and...Oh	God.
_Lucas?_

“What	was	all	that	about?”	Pop	asks.	“What	took	so	long?”
“There’s	new	evidence,”	I	say	woodenly.
“Yeah?	What’s	that?”
I	can’t.	I	can’t.	Not	just	the	two	of	us	in	this	car.	“Let’s	wait	till
we’re	home.”

“This	 serious,	 Coop?”	 Pop	 glances	 at	 me	 as	 he	 passes	 a	 slow-
moving	Volkswagen.	“You	in	trouble?”

My	palms	start	sweating.	“Let’s	wait,”	I	repeat.
I	need	to	tell	Kris	what’s	happening,	but	I	don’t	dare	text	him.	I
should	 go	 to	 his	 apartment	 and	 explain	 in	 person.	 Another
conversation	that’ll	kill	some	part	of	me.	Kris	has	been	out	since	junior
high.	His	parents	are	both	artists	and	it	was	never	a	big	deal.	They
were	pretty	much	like,	 _Yeah,	we	knew.	What	took	you	so	long?_ 	He’s
never	pressured	me,	but	sneaking	around	isn’t	how	he	wants	to	live.

I	stare	out	the	window,	my	fingers	tapping	on	the	door	handle	for
the	rest	of	the	ride	home.	Pop	pulls	into	the	driveway	and	our	house
looms	in	front	of	me:	solid,	familiar,	and	the	last	place	I	want	to	be
right	now.

We	head	inside,	Pop	tossing	his	keys	onto	the	hallway	table	and
catching	sight	of	my	mother	in	the	living	room.	She	and	Nonny	are
sitting	next	to	each	other	on	the	couch	as	though	they’ve	been	waiting
for	us.	“Where’s	Lucas?”	I	ask,	following	Pop	into	the	room.

“Downstairs	playing	Xbox.”	Mom	mutes	the	television	as	Nonny
cocks	her	head	to	one	side	and	fastens	her	eyes	on	me.	“Everything
okay?”

“Cooper’s	being	all	mysterious.”	Pop’s	glance	at	me	is	half	shrewd,
half	dismissive.	He	doesn’t	know	whether	to	take	my	obvious	freaking
out	seriously	or	not.	“You	tell	us,	Cooperstown.	What’s	all	the	fuss
about?	They	got	some	actual	evidence	this	time?”

“They	think	they	do.”	I	clear	my	throat	and	push	my	hands	into
my	khakis.	“I	mean,	they	do.	Have	new	information.”

Everybody’s	quiet,	absorbing	that,	until	they	notice	I’m	not	in	any
hurry	to	continue.	“What	kind	of	new	information?”	Mom	prompts.


“There	was	an	entry	on	Simon’s	site	that	was	encrypted	before	the
police	got	there.	I	guess	it’s	what	he	originally	meant	to	post	about	me.
Nothin’	to	do	with	steroids.”	There	goes	my	accent	again.

Pop	never	lost	his,	and	doesn’t	notice	when	mine	fades	in	and	out.
“I	knew	it!”	he	says	triumphantly.	“They	clear	you,	then?”

I’m	mute,	my	mind	blank.	Nonny	leans	forward,	hands	gripping
her	skull-topped	cane.	“Cooper,	what	was	Simon	going	to	post	about
you?”

“Well.”	A	couple	of	words	is	all	it’ll	take	to	make	everything	in	my
life	 Before	 and	 After.	 The	 air	 leaves	 my	 lungs.	 I	 can’t	 look	 at	 my
mother,	and	I	sure	as	hell	can’t	look	at	my	father.	So	I	focus	on	Nonny.
“Simon.	Somehow.	Found	out.	That.”	 _God._ 	I’ve	run	out	of	filler	words.
Nonny	taps	her	cane	on	the	floor	like	she	wants	to	help	me	along.	“I’m
gay.”

Pop	laughs.	Actually	laughs,	a	relieved	kind	of	guffaw,	and	slaps
me	on	the	shoulder.	“Jesus,	Coop.	Had	me	going	there	for	a	minute.
Seriously,	what’s	up?”

“Kevin.”	Nonny	grits	the	word	through	her	teeth.	“Cooper	is	 _not
joking._ ”

“Course	he	is,”	Pop	says,	still	laughing.	I	watch	his	face,	because
I’m	pretty	sure	it’s	the	last	time	he’ll	look	at	me	the	way	he	always	has.
“Right?”	His	eyes	slide	over	to	mine,	casual	and	confident,	but	when	he
sees	my	face	his	smile	dims.	 _There	it	is._ 	“Right,	Coop?”

```
“Wrong,”	I	tell	him.
```

**Addy**

**Monday,	October	22,	8:45	a.m.**

Police	 cars	 line	 the	 front	 of	 Bayview	 High	 again.	 And	 Cooper’s
stumbling	through	the	hall	like	he	hasn’t	slept	in	days.	It	doesn’t	occur
to	me	the	two	might	be	related	until	he	pulls	me	aside	before	first	bell.
“Can	we	talk?”

I	peer	at	him	more	closely,	unease	gnawing	at	my	stomach.	I’ve
never	seen	Cooper’s	eyes	look	bloodshot	before.	“Yeah,	sure.”	I	think
he	means	here	in	the	hallway,	but	to	my	surprise	he	leads	me	out	the
back	staircase	into	the	parking	lot,	where	we	lean	against	the	wall	next
to	the	door.	Which	means	I’ll	be	late	for	homeroom,	I	guess,	but	my
attendance	 record	 is	 already	 so	 bad	 another	 tardy	 won’t	 make	 a
difference.	“What’s	up?”

Cooper	runs	a	hand	through	his	sandy	hair	until	it	sticks	straight
up,	which	is	not	a	thing	I	ever	imagined	Cooper’s	hair	could	do	until
just	now.	“I	think	the	police	are	here	because	of	me.	To	ask	questions
about	me.	I	just—wanted	to	tell	somebody	why	before	everything	goes
to	hell.”

“Okay.”	I	put	a	hand	on	his	forearm,	and	tense	in	surprise	when	I
feel	it	shaking.	“Cooper,	what’s	wrong?”

“So	the	thing	is...”	He	pauses,	swallowing	hard.
He	looks	like	he’s	about	to	confess	something.	For	a	second	Simon
flashes	 through	 my	 mind:	 his	 collapse	 in	 detention	 and	 his	 red,
gasping	face	as	he	struggled	to	breathe.	I	can’t	help	but	flinch.	Then	I
meet	Cooper’s	eyes—filmy	with	tears,	but	as	kind	as	ever—and	I	know
that	can’t	be	it.	“The	thing	is	what,	Cooper?	It’s	all	right.	You	can	tell
me.”

Cooper	stares	at	me,	taking	in	the	whole	picture—messy	hair	that’s
spiking	oddly	because	I	didn’t	take	the	time	to	blow-dry	it,	so-so	skin


from	all	the	stress,	faded	T-shirt	featuring	some	band	Ashton	used	to
like,	because	we’re	seriously	behind	on	laundry—before	he	replies,	“I’m
gay.”

“Oh.”	It	doesn’t	register	at	first,	and	then	it	does.	 _“Ohhh.”_ 	The
whole	 not-into-Keely	 thing	 suddenly	 makes	 sense.	 It	 seems	 like	 I
should	say	more	than	that,	so	I	add,	“Cool.”	Inadequate	response,	I
guess,	but	sincere.	Because	Cooper’s	pretty	great	except	the	way	he’s
always	been	a	little	remote.	This	explains	 _a	lot._

“Simon	found	out	I’m	seeing	someone.	A	guy.	He	was	gonna	post
it	on	About	That	with	everyone	else’s	entries.	It	got	switched	out	and
replaced	with	a	fake	entry	about	me	using	steroids.	I	didn’t	switch	it,”
he	adds	hastily.	“But	they	think	I	did.	So	they’re	looking	into	me	hard-
core	now,	which	means	the	whole	school	will	know	pretty	soon.	I	guess
I	wanted	to...tell	somebody	myself.”

“Cooper,	no	one	will	care—”	I	start,	but	he	shakes	his	head.
“They	will.	You	know	they	will,”	he	says.	I	drop	my	eyes,	because	I
can’t	deny	it.	“I’ve	been	hiding	my	head	under	a	rock	about	this	whole
investigation,”	he	continues,	his	voice	hoarse.	“Hopin’	they’d	chalk	it
up	to	an	accident	because	there’s	no	real	proof	about	anything.	Now	I
keep	thinking	about	what	Maeve	said	about	Simon	the	other	day—how
much	weird	stuff	was	going	on	around	him.	You	think	there’s	anything
to	that?”

“Bronwyn	does,”	I	say.	“She	wants	the	four	of	us	to	get	together
and	compare	notes.	She	says	Nate	will.”	Cooper	nods	distractedly,	and
it	occurs	to	me	that	since	he’s	still	in	Jake’s	bubble	most	of	the	time,
he’s	not	fully	up	to	speed	on	everything	that’s	been	going	on.	“Did	you
hear	about	Nate’s	mom,	by	the	way?	How	she’s,	um,	not	dead	after
all?”

I	 didn’t	 think	 Cooper	 could	 get	 any	 paler,	 but	 he	 manages.
“What?”

“Kind	of	a	long	story,	but—yeah.	Turns	out	she	was	a	drug	addict
living	 in	 some	 kind	 of	 commune,	 but	 she’s	 back	 now.	 And	 sober,
supposedly.	Oh,	and	Bronwyn	got	called	into	the	police	station	because
of	 a	 creepy	 post	 Simon	 wrote	 about	 her	 sister	 sophomore	 year.
Bronwyn	 told	 him	 to	 drop	 dead	 in	 the	 comments	 section,	 so...you
know.	That	looks	kinda	bad	now.”

```
“The	hell?”	By	the	incredulous	look	on	Cooper’s	face,	I’ve	managed
```

to	distract	him	from	his	problems.	Then	the	late	bell	rings,	and	his
shoulders	sag.	“We’d	better	go.	But,	yeah.	If	you	guys	get	together,	I’m
in.”

```
—
```
The	Bayview	Police	set	themselves	up	in	a	conference	room	with	a
school	liaison	again,	and	start	interviewing	students	one	by	one.	At
first	things	are	kind	of	quiet,	and	when	we	get	through	the	day	without
any	rumors	I’m	hopeful	that	Cooper	was	wrong	about	his	secret	getting
out.	But	by	midmorning	on	Tuesday,	the	whispers	start.	I	don’t	know	if
it’s	the	kind	of	questions	the	police	were	asking,	or	who	they	were
talking	to,	or	just	a	good	old-fashioned	leak,	but	before	lunch	my	ex-
friend	Olivia—who	hasn’t	spoken	to	me	since	Jake	punched	TJ—runs
up	to	my	locker	and	grabs	my	arm	with	a	look	of	pure	glee.

“Oh	my	God.	Did	you	hear	about	Cooper?”	Her	eyes	pop	with
excitement	as	she	lowers	her	voice	to	a	piercing	whisper.	“Everyone’s
saying	he’s	 _gay._ ”

I	pull	away.	If	Olivia	thinks	I’m	grateful	to	be	included	in	the
gossip	mill,	she’s	wrong.	“Who	cares?”	I	say	flatly.

“Well,	 _Keely_ does,”	 Olivia	 giggles,	 tossing	 her	 hair	 over	 her
shoulder.	“No	wonder	he	wouldn’t	sleep	with	her!	Are	you	headed	to
lunch	now?”

“Yeah.	With	Bronwyn.	See	you.”	I	slam	my	locker	shut	and	spin	on
my	heel	before	she	can	say	anything	else.

In	the	cafeteria,	I	collect	my	food	and	head	for	our	usual	table.
Bronwyn	 looks	 pretty	 in	 a	 sweater-dress	 and	 boots,	 her	 hair	 loose
around	her	shoulders.	Her	cheeks	are	so	pink	I	wonder	if	she’s	wearing
makeup	for	a	change,	but	if	she	is	it’s	really	natural.	She	keeps	looking
at	the	door.

“Expecting	someone?”	I	ask.
She	turns	redder.	“Maybe.”
I	 have	 a	 pretty	 good	 idea	 who	 she’s	 waiting	 for.	 Probably	 not
Cooper,	although	the	rest	of	the	room	seems	to	be.	When	he	steps	into
the	cafeteria	everything	goes	quiet,	and	then	a	low	whispering	buzz
runs	through	the	room.

```
“Cooper	 Clay	 is	 Cooper	 GAY!”	 somebody	 calls	 out	 in	 a	 high,
```

falsetto	 voice,	 and	 Cooper	 freezes	 in	 the	 door	 as	 something	 flies
through	the	air	and	hits	him	across	the	chest.	I	recognize	the	blue
packaging	immediately:	Trojan	condoms.	Jake’s	brand.	Along	with	half
the	school,	I	guess.	But	it	did	come	from	the	direction	of	my	old	table.

_“Doin’	the	butt,	hey,	pretty,”_ 	somebody	else	sings,	and	laughter
runs	through	the	room.	Some	of	it’s	mean	but	a	lot	of	it’s	shocked	and
nervous.	Most	people	look	like	they	don’t	know	what	to	do.	I’m	struck
silent	because	Cooper’s	face	is	the	worst	thing	I’ve	ever	seen	and	I
want,	so	badly,	for	this	to	not	be	happening.

“Oh,	 for	 fuck’s	 sake.”	 It’s	 Nate.	 He’s	 in	 the	 entrance	 next	 to
Cooper,	which	surprises	me	since	I’ve	never	seen	him	in	the	cafeteria
before.	The	rest	of	the	room	is	equally	taken	aback,	quieting	enough
that	his	contemptuous	voice	cuts	across	the	whispers	as	he	surveys	the
scene	in	front	of	him.	“You	losers	seriously	give	a	crap	about	this?	Get
a	life.”

A	girl’s	voice	calls	out	“Boyfriend!”	disguised	with	a	fake	cough.
Vanessa	 smirks	 as	 everyone	 around	 her	 dissolves	 into	 the	 kind	 of
laughter	that’s	been	directed	my	way	over	the	past	month:	half-guilty,
half-gleeful,	and	all	 _Thank	God	this	is	happening	to	you	and	not	me._
The	only	exceptions	are	Keely,	who’s	biting	her	lip	and	staring	at	the
floor,	and	Luis,	who’s	half	standing	with	his	forearms	braced	on	the
table.	 One	 of	 the	 lunch	 ladies	 hovers	 in	 the	 doorway	 between	 the
kitchen	and	the	cafeteria,	seemingly	torn	between	letting	things	play
out	and	getting	a	teacher	to	intervene.

Nate	zeroes	in	on	Vanessa’s	smug	face	without	a	trace	of	self-
consciousness.	 “Really?	 _You’ve_ got	 something	 to	 say?	 I	 don’t	 even
know	your	name	and	you	tried	to	stick	your	hand	down	my	pants	the
last	time	we	were	at	a	party.”	More	laughter,	but	this	time	it’s	not	at
Cooper’s	expense.	“In	fact,	if	there’s	a	guy	at	Bayview	you	haven’t	tried
that	with,	I’d	love	to	meet	him.”

Vanessa’s	mouth	hangs	open	as	a	hand	shoots	up	from	the	middle
of	the	cafeteria.	“Me,”	calls	a	boy	sitting	at	the	computer-nerd	table.
His	friends	all	laugh	nervously	as	the	pulsing	attention	of	the	room—
seriously,	it’s	like	a	wave	moving	from	one	target	to	the	next—focuses
on	them.	Nate	gives	him	a	thumbs-up	and	looks	back	at	Vanessa.

“There	you	go.	Try	to	make	that	happen	and	shut	the	hell	up.”	He
crosses	to	our	table	and	dumps	his	backpack	next	to	Bronwyn.	She


stands	up,	winds	her	arms	around	his	neck,	and	kisses	him	like	they’re
alone	while	the	entire	cafeteria	erupts	into	gasps	and	catcalls.	I	stare	as
much	as	everyone	else.	I	mean,	I	kind	of	guessed,	but	this	is	pretty
public.	 I’m	 not	 sure	 if	 Bronwyn’s	 trying	 to	 distract	 everyone	 from
Cooper	or	if	she	couldn’t	help	herself.	Maybe	both.

Either	way,	Cooper’s	effectively	been	forgotten.	He’s	motionless	at
the	entrance	until	I	grab	his	arm.	“Come	sit.	The	whole	murder	club	at
one	table.	They	can	stare	at	all	of	us	together.”

Cooper	 follows	 me,	 not	 bothering	 to	 get	 any	 food.	 We	 settle
ourselves	at	the	table	and	awkward	silence	descends	until	someone
else	approaches:	Luis	with	his	tray	in	hand,	lowering	himself	into	the
last	empty	chair	at	our	table.

“That	was	bullshit,”	he	fumes,	looking	at	the	empty	space	in	front
of	Cooper.	“Aren’t	you	gonna	eat?”

“I’m	not	hungry,”	Cooper	says	shortly.
“You	should	eat	something.”	Luis	grabs	the	only	untouched	food
item	on	his	tray	and	holds	it	out.	“Here,	have	a	banana.”

Everyone	freezes	for	a	second;	then	we	all	burst	out	laughing	at
the	same	time.	Including	Cooper,	who	rests	his	chin	in	his	palm	and
massages	his	temple	with	his	other	hand.

“I’ll	pass,”	he	says.
I’ve	never	seen	Luis	so	red.	“Why	couldn’t	it	have	been	apple	day?”
he	mutters,	and	Cooper	gives	him	a	tired	smile.

You	 find	 out	 who	 your	 real	 friends	 are	 when	 stuff	 like	 this
happens.	Turns	out	I	didn’t	have	any,	but	I’m	glad	Cooper	does.


**Nate**

**Thursday,	October	25,	12:20	a.m.**

I	ease	my	motorcycle	into	the	cul-de-sac	at	the	end	of	Bayview	Estates
and	kill	the	motor,	staying	still	for	a	minute	to	check	for	any	hint	that
someone’s	nearby.	It’s	quiet,	so	I	climb	off	and	give	a	hand	to	Bronwyn
so	she	can	do	the	same.

The	neighborhood	is	still	a	half-finished	construction	area	with	no
streetlights,	so	Bronwyn	and	I	walk	in	darkness	to	house	number	5.
When	we	get	there	I	try	the	front	door,	but	it’s	locked.	We	circle	to	the
back	of	the	house	and	I	jiggle	each	window	until	I	find	one	that	opens.
It’s	low	enough	to	the	ground	that	I	haul	myself	in	easily.	“Go	back	out
front;	I’ll	let	you	in,”	I	say	in	a	low	voice.

“I	think	I	can	do	it	too,”	Bronwyn	says,	preparing	to	pull	herself
up.	She	doesn’t	have	the	arm	strength,	though,	and	I	have	to	lean	over
and	help	her.	The	window’s	not	big	enough	for	two,	and	when	I	let	go
and	step	back	to	give	her	room,	she	scrambles	the	rest	of	the	way	and
lands	on	the	floor	with	a	thud.

“Graceful,”	I	say	as	she	gets	to	her	feet	and	brushes	off	her	jeans.
“Shut	up,”	she	mutters,	looking	around.	“Should	we	unlock	the
front	for	Addy	and	Cooper?”

We’re	in	an	empty,	under-construction	house	after	midnight	for	a
meeting	of	the	Bayview	Four.	It’s	like	a	bad	spy	movie,	but	there’s	no
way	all	of	us	could	get	together	anywhere	else	without	drawing	too
much	attention.	Even	my	don’t-give-a-crap	neighbors	are	suddenly	in
my	business	now	that	Mikhail	Powers’s	team	keeps	cruising	down	our
street.

Plus,	Bronwyn’s	still	grounded.
“Yeah,”	I	say,	and	we	feel	our	way	through	a	half-built	kitchen	and
into	a	living	room	with	a	huge	bay	window.	The	moonlight	streams


bright	across	the	door,	and	I	twist	its	dead	bolt	open.	“What	time	did
you	tell	them?”

“Twelve-thirty,”	she	says,	pressing	a	button	on	her	Apple	watch.
“What	time	is	it?”
“Twelve-twenty-five.”
“Good.	We	have	five	minutes.”	I	slide	my	hand	along	the	side	of
her	face	and	back	her	up	against	the	wall,	pulling	her	lips	to	mine.	She
leans	into	me	and	wraps	her	arms	around	my	neck,	opening	her	mouth
with	a	soft	sigh.	My	hands	travel	down	the	curve	of	her	waist	to	her
hips,	finding	a	strip	of	bare	skin	under	the	hem	of	her	shirt.	Bronwyn
has	this	unbelievable	stealth	body	under	all	her	conservative	clothes,
although	I’ve	barely	gotten	to	see	any	of	it.

“Nate,”	she	whispers	after	a	few	minutes,	in	that	breathless	voice
that	drives	me	wild.	“You	were	going	to	tell	me	how	things	went	with
your	mom.”

Yeah.	I	guess	I	was.	I	saw	my	mother	again	this	afternoon	and	it
was...all	right.	She	showed	up	on	time	and	sober.	She	backed	off	asking
questions	and	gave	me	money	for	bills.	But	I	spent	the	whole	time
taking	bets	with	myself	on	how	long	it’d	last.	Current	odds	say	two
weeks.

Before	I	can	answer,	though,	the	door	creaks	and	we’re	not	alone
anymore.	A	small	figure	slips	inside	and	shuts	the	door	behind	her.
The	moonlight’s	bright	enough	that	I	can	see	Addy	clearly,	including
the	unexpected	dark	streaks	in	her	hair.	“Oh,	good,	I’m	not	the	first
one,”	she	whispers,	then	puts	her	hands	on	her	hips	as	she	glares	at
Bronwyn	and	me.	“Are	you	two	making	out?	Seriously?”

“Did	you	dye	your	hair?”	Bronwyn	counters,	pulling	away	from
me.	“What	color	is	that?”	She	reaches	a	hand	out	and	examines	Addy’s
bangs.	“Purple?	I	like	it.	Why	the	change?”

“I	can’t	keep	up	with	the	maintenance	requirements	of	short	hair,”
Addy	grumbles,	dropping	a	bike	helmet	on	the	floor.	“It	doesn’t	look	as
bad	with	color	mixed	in.”	She	cocks	her	head	at	me	and	adds,	“I	don’t
need	your	commentary	if	you	disagree,	by	the	way.”

```
I	hold	up	my	hands.	“Wasn’t	going	to	say	a	word,	Addy.”
“When	did	you	even	start	knowing	my	name,”	she	deadpans.
```

I	grin	at	her.	“You’ve	gotten	kinda	feisty	since	you	lost	all	the	hair.
And	the	boyfriend.”

She	rolls	her	eyes.	“Where	are	we	doing	this?	Living	room?”
“Yeah,	but	back	corner.	Away	from	the	window,”	Bronwyn	says,
picking	her	way	through	construction	supplies	and	sitting	cross-legged
in	front	of	a	stone	fireplace.	I	sprawl	next	to	her	and	wait	for	Addy	to
follow,	but	she’s	still	poised	near	the	door.

“I	 think	 I	 hear	 something,”	 she	 says,	 peering	 through	 the
peephole.	She	opens	the	door	a	crack	and	steps	aside	to	let	Cooper	in.
Addy	leads	him	toward	the	fireplace	but	nearly	goes	flying	when	she
trips	on	an	extension	cord.	“ _Ow!_ 	Damn	it,	that	was	loud.	Sorry.”	She
settles	herself	next	to	Bronwyn,	and	Cooper	sits	beside	her.

“How	are	things?”	Bronwyn	asks	Cooper.
He	rubs	a	hand	over	his	face.	“Oh,	you	know.	Livin’	the	nightmare.
My	father	won’t	talk	to	me,	I’m	getting	torn	apart	online,	and	none	of
the	 teams	 that	 were	 scouting	 me	 will	 return	 Coach	 Ruffalo’s	 calls.
Other	than	that	I’m	great.”

“I’m	so	sorry,”	Bronwyn	says,	and	Addy	grabs	his	hand	and	folds	it
in	both	of	hers.

He	heaves	a	sigh	but	doesn’t	pull	away.	“It	is	what	it	is,	I	guess.
Let’s	just	get	to	why	we’re	here,	huh?”

Bronwyn	clears	her	throat.	“Well.	Mainly	to...compare	notes?	Eli
kept	talking	about	looking	for	patterns	and	connections,	which	makes
a	lot	of	sense.	I	thought	maybe	we	could	go	through	some	of	the	things
we	know.	And	don’t	know.”	She	frowns	and	starts	ticking	things	off	on
her	fingers.	“Simon	was	about	to	post	some	pretty	shocking	things
about	all	of	us.	Somebody	got	us	into	that	room	together	with	the	fake
cell	phones.	Simon	was	poisoned	while	we	were	there.	Lots	of	people
besides	us	had	reasons	to	be	mad	at	Simon.	He	was	mixed	up	in	all
kinds	of	creepy	4chan	stuff.	Who	knows	what	kind	of	people	he	pissed
off.”

“Janae	said	he	hated	being	an	outsider	and	he	was	really	upset
nothing	 more	 ever	 happened	 with	 Keely,”	 Addy	 says,	 looking	 at
Cooper.	 “Do	 you	 remember	 that?	 He	 started	 hitting	 on	 her	 during
junior	prom,	and	she	caved	at	a	party	a	couple	weeks	later	and	hooked
up	with	him	for,	like,	five	minutes.	He	thought	it	was	actually	going


somewhere.”

Cooper	hunches	his	shoulders	like	he’s	remembering	something
he’d	rather	not.	“Right.	Huh.	I	guess	that’s	a	pattern.	Or	a	connection,
or	whatever.	With	me	and	Nate,	I	mean.”

I	don’t	get	it.	“What?”
He	meets	my	eyes.	“When	I	broke	up	with	Keely,	she	told	me	she’d
hooked	up	with	you	at	a	party	to	get	rid	of	Simon.	And	I	asked	her	out
a	couple	weeks	after.”

“You	and	 _Keely_ ?”	Addy	stares	at	me.	“She	never	said!”
“It	was	just	a	couple	times.”	Honestly,	I’d	forgotten	all	about	it.
“And	you’re	good	friends	with	Keely.	Or	you	were,”	Bronwyn	says
to	Addy.	She	doesn’t	seem	fazed	at	the	idea	of	Keely	and	me	getting
together,	and	I	have	to	appreciate	how	she	doesn’t	lose	focus.	“But	I
have	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 her.	 So...I	 don’t	 know.	 Does	 that	 mean
something,	or	doesn’t	it?”

“I	don’t	see	how	it	could,”	Cooper	says.	“Nobody	except	Simon
cared	what	happened	between	him	and	Keely.”

“ _Keely_ 	might	have,”	Bronwyn	points	out.
Cooper	stifles	a	laugh.	“You	can’t	think	Keely	had	anything	to	do
with	this!”

“We’re	 freewheeling	 here,”	 Bronwyn	 says,	 leaning	 forward	 and
propping	her	chin	in	her	hand.	“She’s	a	common	thread.”

“Yeah,	but	Keely	has	zero	motive	for	anything.	Shouldn’t	we	be
talking	about	people	who	hated	Simon?	Besides	you,”	Cooper	adds,
and	Bronwyn	goes	rigid.	“I	mean,	for	that	blog	post	he	wrote	about
your	sister.	Addy	told	me	about	it.	That	was	low,	really	low.	I	never	saw
it	the	first	time	around.	I’d	have	said	something	if	I	did.”

“Well,	I	didn’t	 _kill_ 	him	for	it,”	Bronwyn	says	tightly.
“I’m	not	 _saying_ —”	Cooper	starts,	but	Addy	interrupts.
“Let’s	stay	on	track.	What	about	Leah,	or	even	Aiden	Wu?	You
can’t	tell	me	they	wouldn’t	have	liked	revenge.”

Bronwyn	swallows	and	lowers	her	eyes.	“I	wonder	about	Leah	too.
She’s	been...Well,	I	have	a	connection	to	her	I	haven’t	told	you	guys
about.	She	and	I	were	partners	in	a	Model	UN	competition,	and	by


mistake	we	told	Simon	a	wrong	deadline	that	got	him	disqualified.	He
started	torturing	Leah	on	About	That	right	after.”

Bronwyn’s	told	me	this,	actually.	It’s	been	eating	at	her	for	a	while.
But	it’s	news	to	Cooper	and	Addy,	who	starts	bobbing	her	head.	“So
Leah’s	 got	 a	 reason	 to	 hate	 Simon	 _and_ be	 mad	 at	 you.”	 Then	 she
frowns.	“But	what	about	the	rest	of	us?	Why	drag	us	along?”

I	 shrug.	 “Maybe	 we	 were	 just	 the	 secrets	 Simon	 had	 on	 hand.
Collateral	damage.”

Bronwyn	sighs.	“I	don’t	know.	Leah’s	hotheaded,	but	not	exactly
sneaky.	 I’m	 more	 confused	 about	 Janae’s	 deal.”	 She	 turns	 toward
Addy.	“One	of	the	strangest	things	about	the	Tumblr	is	how	many
details	it	got	right.	You’d	almost	have	to	be	one	of	us	to	know	that	stuff
—or	spend	a	lot	of	time	with	us.	Don’t	you	think	it’s	weird	that	Janae
hangs	 out	 with	 us	 even	 though	 we’re	 accused	 of	 killing	 her	 best
friend?”

“Well,	to	be	fair,	I	 _did_ invite	 her,”	 Addy	 says.	 “But	 she’s	 been
awfully	skittish	lately.	And	did	you	guys	notice	she	and	Simon	weren’t
together	as	much	as	usual	right	before	he	died?	I	keep	wondering	if
something	happened	between	them.”	She	leans	back	and	chews	on	her
bottom	lip.	“I	suppose	if	anybody	would’ve	known	what	secrets	Simon
was	about	to	spill	and	how	to	use	them,	it’d	be	Janae.	I	just...I	don’t
know,	you	guys.	I’m	not	sure	Janae’s	got	it	in	her	to	do	something	like
this.”

“Maybe	Simon	rejected	her	and	she...killed	him?”	Cooper	looks
doubtful	before	he	finishes	the	sentence.	“Don’t	see	how,	though.	She
wasn’t	there.”

Bronwyn	shrugs.	“We	don’t	know	that	for	sure.	When	I	talked	to
Eli,	he	kept	saying	somebody	could’ve	planned	the	car	accident	as	a
distraction	 to	 slip	 into	 the	 room.	 If	 you	 take	 that	 as	 a	 possibility,
anyone	could’ve	done	it.”

I	made	fun	of	Bronwyn	when	she	first	brought	that	up,	but—I
don’t	know.	I	wish	I	could	remember	more	about	that	day,	could	say
for	sure	whether	it’s	even	possible.	The	whole	thing’s	turned	into	a
blur.

“One	 of	 the	 cars	 was	 a	 red	 Camaro,”	 Cooper	 recalls.	 “Looked
ancient.	I	don’t	remember	ever	seeing	it	in	the	parking	lot	before.	Or
since.	Which	 _is_ 	weird	when	you	think	about	it.”


“Oh,	come	on,”	Addy	scoffs.	“That’s	so	far-fetched.	Sounds	like	a
lawyer	 with	 a	 guilty	 client	 grasping	 at	 straws.	 Someone	 new	 was
probably	just	picking	up	a	kid	that	day.”

“Maybe,”	Cooper	says.	“I	dunno.	Luis’s	brother	works	in	a	repair
place	downtown.	Maybe	I’ll	ask	him	if	a	car	like	that	came	through,	or
if	he	can	check	with	some	other	shops.”	He	holds	up	a	hand	at	Addy’s
raised	 brows.	 “Hey,	 _you’re_ not	 the	 police’s	 favorite	 new	 person	 of
interest,	okay?	I’m	desperate	here.”

We’re	not	getting	anywhere	with	this	conversation.	But	I’m	struck
by	a	couple	of	things	as	I	listen	to	them	talk.	One:	I	like	all	of	them
more	than	I	thought	I	would.	Bronwyn’s	obviously	been	the	biggest
surprise,	and	 _like_ 	doesn’t	cover	it.	But	Addy’s	turned	into	kind	of	a
badass,	and	Cooper’s	not	as	one-dimensional	as	I	thought.

```
And	two:	I	don’t	think	any	of	them	did	it.
```
**Bronwyn**

**Friday,	October	26,	8:00	p.m.**

Friday	 night	 my	 entire	 family	 settles	 in	 to	 watch	 _Mikhail	 Powers
Investigates._ I’m	 feeling	 more	 dread	 than	 usual,	 between	 bracing
myself	 for	 Simon’s	 blog	 post	 about	 Maeve	 and	 worrying	 that
something	about	Nate	and	me	will	make	it	into	the	broadcast.	I	never
should	 have	 kissed	 him	 at	 school.	 Although	 in	 my	 defense	 he	 was
unbelievably	hot	at	that	particular	moment.

Anyway.	We’re	all	nervous.	Maeve	curls	next	to	me	as	Mikhail’s
theme	music	plays	and	photos	of	Bayview	flash	across	the	screen.

_A	 murder	 investigation	 turns	 witch	 hunt.	 When	 police	 tactics
include	 revealing	 personal	 information	 in	 the	 name	 of	 evidence
collection,	have	they	gone	too	far?_

Wait.	What?
The	 camera	 zooms	 in	 on	 Mikhail,	 and	 he	 is	 _pissed._ I	 sit	 up
straighter	as	he	stares	into	the	camera	and	says,	“Things	in	Bayview,
California,	turned	ugly	this	week	when	a	closeted	student	involved	in
the	investigation	was	outed	after	a	round	of	police	questioning,	causing
a	 media	 firestorm	 that	 should	 concern	 every	 American	 who	 cares
about	privacy	rights.”

And	then	I	remember.	Mikhail	Powers	is	gay.	He	came	out	when	I
was	in	junior	high	and	it	was	a	big	deal	because	it	happened	after	some


photos	of	him	kissing	a	guy	circulated	online.	It	wasn’t	his	choice.	And
from	the	way	he’s	covering	the	story	now,	he’s	still	bitter.

Because	suddenly	the	Bayview	Police	are	the	bad	guys.	They	have
no	evidence,	they’ve	disrupted	our	lives,	and	they’ve	violated	Cooper’s
constitutional	rights.	They’re	on	the	defensive	as	a	police	spokesperson
claims	they	were	careful	in	their	questioning	and	no	leaks	came	from
the	department.	But	the	ACLU	wants	to	get	involved	now.	And	there’s
Eli	Kleinfelter	from	Until	Proven	again,	talking	about	how	poorly	this
case	has	been	handled	from	the	beginning,	with	the	four	of	us	made
into	 scapegoats	 while	 nobody	 even	 asks	 who	 else	 might’ve	 wanted
Simon	Kelleher	dead.

“Has	 everybody	 forgotten	 about	 the	 teacher?”	 he	 asks,	 leaning
forward	from	behind	an	overflowing	desk.	“He’s	the	only	person	who
was	in	that	room	who’s	being	treated	as	a	witness	instead	of	a	suspect,
even	 though	 he	 had	 more	 opportunity	 than	 anyone.	 That	 can’t	 be
discounted.”

Maeve	leans	her	head	next	to	mine	and	whispers,	“You	should	be
working	for	Until	Proven,	Bronwyn.”

Mikhail	 switches	 to	 the	 next	 segment:	 _Will	 the	 real	 Simon
Kelleher	 please	 stand	 up?_ Simon’s	 class	 picture	 flashes	 across	 the
screen	as	people	reminisce	about	his	good	grades	and	nice	family	and
all	the	clubs	he	belonged	to.	Then	Leah	Jackson	pops	up	on-screen,
standing	on	Bayview	High’s	front	lawn.	I	turn	to	Maeve,	eyes	wide,	and
she	looks	equally	shocked.

“She	did	it,”	she	murmurs.	“She	actually	did	it.”
Leah’s	interview	is	followed	by	segments	with	other	kids	hurt	by
Simon’s	gossip,	including	Aiden	Wu	and	a	girl	whose	parents	kicked
her	out	when	news	spread	about	her	being	pregnant.	Maeve’s	hand
finds	mine	as	Mikhail	drops	his	last	bombshell—a	screen	capture	of	the
4chan	discussion	threads,	with	Simon’s	worst	posts	about	the	Orange
County	school	shooting	highlighted:

```
Look,	I	support	the	notion	of	violently	disrupting	schools	in	theory,	but	this	kid
showed	a	depressing	lack	of	imagination.	I	mean,	it	was	fine,	I	guess.	It	got	the
job	done.	But	it	was	so	prosaic.	Haven’t	we	seen	this	a	hundred	times	now?
Kid	shoots	up	school,	shoots	up	self,	film	at	eleven.	Raise	the	stakes,	for	God’s
sake.	Do	something	original.
A	grenade,	maybe.	Samurai	swords?	Surprise	me	when	you	take	out	a
bunch	of	asshole	lemmings.	That’s	all	I’m	asking.
```

I	think	back	to	Maeve	texting	away	that	day	Janae	got	so	upset
with	her	at	lunch.	“So	you	really	did	send	that	to	the	show?”	I	whisper.

“I	really	did,”	she	whispers	back.	“I	didn’t	know	they’d	use	them,
though.	Nobody	ever	got	back	to	me.”

By	the	time	the	broadcast	finishes,	the	Bayview	Police	are	the	real
villains,	followed	closely	by	Simon.	Addy,	Nate,	and	I	are	innocent
bystanders	 caught	 in	 a	 cross	 fire	 we	 don’t	 deserve,	 and	 Cooper’s	 a
saint.	The	whole	thing’s	a	stunning	reversal.

```

```
I’m	 not	 sure	 you	 could	 call	 it	 journalism,	 but	 _Mikhail	 Powers
Investigates_ definitely	 has	 an	 impact	 over	 the	 next	 few	 days.
Somebody	starts	a	Change.org	petition	to	drop	the	investigation	that
collects	 almost	 twenty	 thousand	 signatures.	 The	 MLB	 and	 local
colleges	get	heat	about	whether	they	discriminate	against	gay	players.
The	 tone	 of	 the	 media	 coverage	 shifts,	 with	 more	 questions	 being
raised	about	the	police’s	handling	of	the	case	than	about	us.	And	when
I	return	to	school	on	Monday,	people	actually	talk	to	me	again.	Even
Evan	Neiman,	who’s	been	acting	like	we’ve	never	met,	sidles	up	to	me
at	the	last	bell	and	asks	if	I’m	going	to	Mathlete	practice.

Maybe	my	life	won’t	ever	be	fully	normal	again,	but	by	the	end	of
the	week	I	start	to	hope	it’ll	be	less	criminal.

Friday	night	I’m	on	the	phone	with	Nate	as	usual,	reading	him	the
latest	Tumblr	post.	Even	that	seems	like	it’s	about	to	give	up:

```
Being	accused	of	murder	is	turning	into	a	monumental	drag.	I	mean,	sure,	the
TV	coverage	is	interesting.	And	it	makes	me	feel	good	that	the	smoke	screen	I
put	in	place	is	working—people	still	have	no	clue	who’s	responsible	for	killing
Simon.
```
Nate	cuts	me	off	after	the	first	paragraph.	“Sorry,	but	we	have
more	 important	 things	 to	 discuss.	 Answer	 this	 honestly:	 If	 I’m	 no
longer	a	murder	suspect,	will	you	still	find	me	attractive?”

“You’ll	still	be	on	probation	for	drug	dealing,”	I	point	out.	“That’s
pretty	hot.”

“Ah,	but	that’s	up	in	December,”	Nate	replies.	“By	the	new	year	I
could	be	a	model	citizen.	Your	parents	might	even	let	me	take	you	out
on	an	actual	date.	If	you	wanted	to	go.”

```
If	I	wanted	to	go. 	“Nate,	I’ve	been	waiting	to	go	on	a	date	with	you
```

since	fifth	grade,”	I	tell	him.	I	like	that	he	wonders	what	we’ll	be	like
outside	 this	 weird	 bubble.	 Maybe	 if	 we’re	 both	 thinking	 about	 it,
there’s	a	possibility	we’ll	figure	it	out.

He	tells	me	about	his	latest	visit	with	his	mother,	who	really	seems
to	be	trying.	We	watch	a	movie	together—his	choice,	unfortunately—
and	I	fall	asleep	to	his	voice	criticizing	the	shoddy	camerawork.	When	I
wake	up	Saturday	morning,	I	notice	my	phone	has	only	a	few	minutes
left.	I’ll	have	to	ask	him	for	another	one.	Which	will	be	phone	number
four,	I	think.

Maybe	we	can	use	our	actual	phones	one	of	these	days.
I	stay	in	bed	a	little	later	than	usual,	right	up	till	the	time	I	need	to
get	moving	if	Maeve	and	I	are	going	to	do	our	usual	running-slash-
library	routine.	I’ve	just	finished	lacing	up	my	sneakers	and	am	rooting
around	in	my	dresser	for	my	Nano	when	a	tentative	knock	sounds	on
my	bedroom	door.

“Come	in,”	I	say,	unearthing	a	small	blue	device	from	a	pile	of
headbands.	“Is	that	you,	Maeve?	Are	you	the	reason	this	is	only	ten
percent	charged?”	I	turn	around	to	see	my	sister	so	white-faced	and
trembling	that	I	almost	drop	my	Nano.	Anytime	Maeve	looks	sick,	I’m
seized	with	the	horrible	fear	she’s	had	a	relapse.	“Do	you	feel	all	right?”
I	ask	anxiously.

“I’m	fine.”	The	words	come	out	as	a	gasp.	“But	you	need	to	see
something.	Come	downstairs,	okay?”

“What’s	going	on?”
“Just...come.”	Maeve’s	voice	is	so	brittle	that	my	heart	thumps
painfully.	She	clutches	the	banister	all	the	way	downstairs.	I’m	about	to
ask	if	something’s	wrong	with	Mom	or	Dad	when	she	leads	me	into	the
living	room	and	points	mutely	at	the	television.

Where	I	see	Nate	in	handcuffs,	being	led	away	from	his	house,
with	the	words	 _Arrest	in	the	Simon	Kelleher	Murder	Case_ 	scrolling	on
the	bottom	of	the	screen.


**Bronwyn**

**Saturday,	November	3,	10:17	a.m.**

This	time	I	 _do_ 	drop	my	Nano.

It	slips	from	my	hand	and	thuds	softly	onto	our	rug	as	I	watch	one
of	the	police	officers	flanking	Nate	open	the	cruiser	door	and	push	him,
not	very	gently,	into	the	backseat.	The	scene	cuts	to	a	reporter	standing
outdoors,	 brushing	 windswept	 dark	 hair	 out	 of	 her	 face.	 “Bayview
Police	 refused	 to	 comment,	 other	 than	 to	 say	 that	 new	 evidence
provides	probable	cause	to	charge	Nate	Macauley,	the	only	one	of	the
Bayview	Four	with	a	criminal	record,	with	Simon	Kelleher’s	murder.
We’ll	continue	to	provide	updates	as	the	story	unfolds.	I’m	Liz	Rosen,
reporting	for	Channel	Seven	News.”

Maeve	stands	next	to	me,	the	remote	in	her	hand.	I	pluck	at	her
sleeve.	“Can	you	rewind	to	the	beginning,	please?”

She	 does,	 and	 I	 study	 Nate’s	 face	 in	 the	 looping	 video.	 His
expression	 is	 blank,	 almost	 bored,	 as	 though	 he’s	 been	 talked	 into
going	to	a	party	that	doesn’t	interest	him.

I	know	that	look.	It’s	the	same	one	he	got	when	I	mentioned	Until
Proven	 at	 the	 mall.	 He’s	 shutting	 down	 and	 putting	 up	 defenses.
There’s	no	trace	of	the	boy	I	know	from	the	phone,	or	our	motorcycle
rides,	or	my	media	room.	Or	the	one	I	remember	from	grade	school,
his	 St.	 Pius	 tie	 askew	 and	 his	 shirt	 untucked,	 leading	 his	 sobbing
mother	down	the	hallway	with	a	fierce	look	that	dared	any	of	us	to
laugh.

I	still	believe	that	Nate’s	the	real	one.	Whatever	the	police	think,
or	found,	doesn’t	change	that.

My	parents	aren’t	home.	I	grab	my	phone	and	call	my	lawyer,
Robin,	who	doesn’t	answer.	I	leave	her	such	a	long,	rambling	message
that	her	voice	mail	cuts	me	off,	and	I	hang	up	feeling	helpless.	Robin’s


my	only	hope	for	getting	information,	but	she	won’t	consider	this	an
emergency.	It’s	a	problem	for	Nate’s	future	lawyer,	not	her.

That	 thought	 makes	 me	 even	 more	 panicked.	 What’s	 an
overworked	public	defender	who’s	never	met	Nate	going	to	be	able	to
do?	My	eyes	dart	around	the	room	and	meet	Maeve’s	troubled	gaze.

“Do	you	think	he	might	have—”
“No,”	I	say	forcefully.	“Come	on,	Maeve,	you’ve	seen	how	screwed
up	 this	 investigation	 is.	 They	 thought	 _I_ did	 it	 for	 a	 while.	 They’re
wrong.	I’m	positive	they’re	wrong.”

“I	wonder	what	they	found,	though,”	Maeve	says.	“You’d	think
they’d	be	pretty	careful	after	all	the	bad	press	they	got	this	week.”

I	don’t	answer.	For	once	in	my	life	I	have	no	idea	what	to	do.	My
brain’s	empty	of	everything	except	a	churning	anxiety.	Channel	7	has
given	up	pretending	they	know	anything	new,	and	they’re	replaying
snippets	about	the	investigation	to	date.	There’s	footage	from	 _Mikhail
Powers	 Investigates._ Addy	 in	 her	 pixie	 haircut,	 giving	 whoever’s
filming	 her	 a	 defiant	 finger.	 A	 Bayview	 Police	 Department
spokesperson.	Eli	Kleinfelter.

_Of	course._
I	grab	my	phone	and	search	for	Eli’s	name.	He	gave	me	his	cell	the
last	time	we	spoke	and	told	me	to	call	anytime.	I	hope	he	meant	it.

He	answers	on	the	first	ring.	“Eli	Kleinfelter.”
“Eli?	It’s	Bronwyn	Rojas.	From—”
“Of	course.	Hi,	Bronwyn.	I	take	it	you’re	watching	the	news.	What
do	you	make	of	it?”

“They’re	wrong.”	I	stare	at	the	television	while	Maeve	stares	at	me.
Dread’s	creeping	through	me	like	a	fast-growing	vine,	squeezing	my
heart	and	lungs	so	it’s	hard	to	breathe.	“Eli,	Nate	needs	a	better	lawyer
than	whatever	random	public	defender	they’ll	assign	him.	He	needs
somebody	who	gives	a	crap	and	knows	what	they’re	doing.	I	think,	um,
well—basically	I	think	he	needs	you.	Would	you	consider	taking	his
case?”

Eli	doesn’t	answer	straightaway,	and	when	he	does	his	voice	is
cautious.	 “Bronwyn,	 you	 know	 I’m	 interested	 in	 this	 case,	 and	 I
sympathize	with	all	of	you.	You’ve	gotten	a	shit	deal	and	I’m	sure	this


arrest	is	more	of	the	same.	But	I’ve	got	an	impossible	workload	as	it	is
—”

_“Please,”_ 	I	interrupt,	and	words	tumble	out	of	me.	I	tell	Eli	about
Nate’s	parents	and	how	he’s	practically	raised	himself	since	he	was	in
fifth	grade.	I	tell	him	every	awful,	heart-wrenching	story	Nate’s	ever
told	me,	or	that	I	witnessed	or	guessed.	Nate	would	hate	it,	but	I’ve
never	believed	anything	more	strongly	than	I	believe	he	needs	Eli	to
stay	out	of	jail.

“All	right,	all	right,”	Eli	says	finally.	“I	get	it.	I	really	do.	Are	either
of	these	parents	in	any	shape	to	talk?	I’ll	make	time	for	a	consult	and
give	them	some	ideas	for	resources.	That’s	all	I	can	do.”

It’s	not	enough,	but	it’s	something.	“Yes!”	I	say	with	brazen	fake
confidence.	 Nate	 talked	 to	 his	 mother	 two	 days	 ago	 and	 she	 was
holding	on,	but	I	have	no	idea	what	effect	today’s	news	might	have	on
her.	“I’ll	talk	to	Nate’s	mom.	When	can	we	meet?”

“Ten	tomorrow,	our	offices.”
Maeve’s	still	watching	me	when	I	hang	up.	“Bronwyn,	what	are
you	doing?”

I	snatch	the	keys	to	the	Volvo	from	the	kitchen	island.	“I	need	to
find	Mrs.	Macauley.”

Maeve	bites	her	lip.	“Bronwyn,	you	can’t—”
_Run	this	like	it’s	student	council?_ 	She’s	right.	I	need	help.	“Will
you	come?	Please?”

She	debates	for	half	a	minute,	her	amber	eyes	steady	on	mine.	“All
right.”

My	phone	almost	slips	out	of	my	sweaty	palm	as	we	head	for	the
car.	I	must’ve	gotten	a	dozen	calls	and	texts	while	I	was	talking	with
Eli.	My	parents,	my	friends,	and	a	bunch	of	numbers	I	don’t	recognize
that	probably	belong	to	reporters.	I	have	four	messages	from	Addy,	all
some	variation	of	 _Did	you	see?_ 	and	 _WTF?_

“Are	we	telling	Mom	and	Dad	about	this?”	Maeve	asks	as	I	back
out	of	the	driveway.

“What	‘this’?	Nate’s	arrest?”
“I’m	 pretty	 sure	 they’re	 in	 the	 loop	 on	 that.	 This...legal
coordination	you’re	doing.”


“Do	you	disapprove?”
“Not	 _disapprove,_ 	exactly.	But	you’re	flying	off	the	handle	before
you	 even	 know	 what	 the	 police	 found.	 It	 could	 be	 cut-and-dried.	 I
know	you	really	like	him,	but...isn’t	it	possible	he	did	this?”

“No,”	I	say	shortly.	“And	yes.	I’ll	tell	Mom	and	Dad.	I’m	not	doing
anything	wrong.	Just	trying	to	help	a	friend.”	My	voice	sticks	on	the
last	word,	and	we	drive	in	silence	until	we	reach	Motel	6.

I’m	relieved	when	the	front	desk	clerk	tells	me	Mrs.	Macauley’s
still	checked	in,	but	she	doesn’t	answer	the	phone	in	her	room.	Which
is	a	good	sign—hopefully	she’s	wherever	Nate	is.	I	leave	a	note	with	my
phone	number	and	try	not	to	overdo	the	underlines	and	capital	letters.
Maeve	takes	over	driving	responsibilities	on	the	ride	home	while	I	call
Addy.

“What	the	hell?”	she	says	when	she	picks	up,	and	the	vise	gripping
my	chest	loosens	at	the	disbelief	in	her	voice.	“First	they	think	it’s	all	of
us.	Then	it’s	musical	chairs	till	they	finally	land	on	Nate,	I	guess.”

“Anything	new?”	I	ask.	“I’ve	been	away	from	screens	for	half	an
hour.”

But	 there’s	 nothing.	 The	 police	 are	 being	 tight-lipped	 about
whatever	 they	 found.	 Addy’s	 lawyer	 doesn’t	 have	 a	 clue	 what’s
happening.	“You	want	to	hang	out	tonight?”	she	asks.	“You	must	be
going	nuts.	My	mom	and	her	boyfriend	have	plans,	so	Ashton	and	I	are
making	pizza.	Bring	Maeve;	we’ll	have	a	sister	night.”

“Maybe.	If	things	aren’t	too	out	of	control,”	I	say	gratefully.
Maeve	turns	into	our	street,	and	my	heart	sinks	when	I	spy	the
line	of	white	news	vans	in	front	of	our	house.	It	looks	like	Univision
and	Telemundo	have	joined	the	fray,	which	is	seriously	going	to	piss
off	my	dad.	He	can	never	get	them	to	cover	anything	positive	about	his
company,	but	 _this_ 	they	show	up	for.

We	pull	into	the	driveway	behind	my	parents’	cars,	and	as	soon	as
I	open	my	door	a	half-dozen	microphones	are	in	my	face.	I	push	past
them	and	meet	Maeve	in	front	of	the	car,	grabbing	her	hand	as	we
weave	 through	 the	 cameras	 and	 the	 flashing	 lights.	 Most	 of	 the
reporters	shout	some	variation	of	“Bronwyn,	do	you	think	Nate	killed
Simon?”	 but	 one	 calls	 out,	 “Bronwyn,	 is	 it	 true	 you	 and	 Nate	 are
romantically	involved?”


I	 _really_ 	hope	my	parents	weren’t	asked	the	same	question.
Maeve	and	I	slam	the	door	behind	us	and	duck	past	the	windows
into	our	kitchen.	Mom	is	sitting	at	the	island	with	a	coffee	cup	between
both	 hands,	 her	 face	 tight	 with	 worry.	 Dad’s	 voice	 rises	 in	 heated
conversation	from	behind	his	closed	office	door.

“Bronwyn,	we	need	to	talk,”	Mom	says,	and	Maeve	floats	away
upstairs.

I	sit	across	from	my	mother	at	the	kitchen	island	and	meet	her
tired	eyes	with	a	pang.	 _My	fault._ 	“Obviously	you	saw	the	news,”	she
says.	 “Your	 father’s	 talking	 to	 Robin	 about	 what,	 if	 anything,	 this
means	for	you.	In	the	meantime,	we	got	a	lot	of	questions	when	we
walked	past	that	zoo	out	there.	Some	about	you	and	Nate.”	I	can	tell
she’s	trying	hard	to	keep	her	voice	neutral.	“We	might	have	made	it
difficult	for	you	to	talk	about	whatever...relationships	you	have	with
the	other	kids.	Because	from	our	perspective	the	best	way	to	keep	you
safe	was	to	keep	you	separate.	So	maybe	you	didn’t	think	you	could
confide	in	us,	but	I	need	you	to	be	straight	with	me	now	that	Nate’s
been	arrested.	Is	there	something	I	should	know?”

At	first	all	I	can	think	is	 _What’s	the	least	amount	of	information	I
can	provide	and	still	make	you	understand	I	need	to	help	Nate?_ 	But
then	she	reaches	out	and	squeezes	my	hand,	and	it	hits	me	with	a	stab
of	guilt	how	I	never	used	to	keep	things	from	her	until	I	cheated	in
chemistry.	And	look	how	 _that_ 	turned	out.

So	I	tell	her	almost	everything.	Not	about	bringing	Nate	to	our
house	 or	 meeting	 him	 at	 Bayview	 Estates,	 because	 I’m	 pretty	 sure
that’ll	send	us	down	a	bad	path.	But	I	explain	the	late-night	phone
calls,	the	escape-from-school	motorcycle	rides,	and,	yeah,	the	kissing.

My	mother	is	trying	 _so_ 	hard	not	to	freak	out.	I	give	her	a	lot	of
credit.

“So	you’re...serious	about	him?”	She	almost	chokes	on	the	words.
She	 doesn’t	 want	 the	 real	 answer.	 Robin’s	 answer-a-different-
question-than-the-one-you’re-trying-to-deflect	 strategy	 would	 work
well	now.	“Mom,	I	understand	this	is	a	bizarre	situation	and	I	don’t
really	know	Nate.	But	I	don’t	believe	he’d	hurt	Simon.	And	he	doesn’t
have	anybody	looking	out	for	him.	He	needs	a	good	lawyer,	so	that’s
what	I’m	trying	to	help	with.”	My	phone	buzzes	with	a	number	I	don’t
recognize,	and	I	grimace	as	I	realize	I	need	to	answer	in	case	it’s	Mrs.


Macauley.	“Hi,	this	is	Bronwyn.”

“Bronwyn,	so	glad	you	picked	up!	This	is	Lisa	Jacoby	with	the	 _Los
Angeles	Ti—_ ”

I	hang	up	and	face	my	mother	again.	“I’m	sorry	I	haven’t	been
straight	with	you	after	everything	you’ve	done	for	me.	But	please	let	me
connect	Mrs.	Macauley	and	Eli.	Okay?”

My	 mother	 massages	 her	 temple.	 “Bronwyn,	 I’m	 not	 sure	 you
understand	how	cavalier	you’ve	been.	You	ignored	Robin’s	advice	and
you’re	lucky	it	didn’t	blow	up	in	your	face.	It	still	might.	But...no,	I
won’t	stop	you	from	talking	with	Nate’s	mother.	This	case	is	messed	up
enough	that	everyone	involved	needs	decent	counsel.”

I	throw	my	arms	around	her	and,	God,	it	feels	good	to	just	hug	my
mom	for	a	minute.

She	sighs	when	I	let	go.	“Let	me	talk	to	your	father.	I	don’t	think	a
conversation	between	you	two	would	be	productive	right	now.”

I	couldn’t	agree	more.	I’m	on	my	way	upstairs	when	my	phone
rings	again,	and	my	heart	leaps	when	I	see	a	503	area	code.	I	can’t	keep
the	hope	out	of	my	voice	when	I	pick	up.	“Hi,	this	is	Bronwyn.”

“Bronwyn,	hello.”	The	voice	is	low	and	strained,	but	clear.	“It’s
Ellen	Macauley.	Nate’s	mother.	You	left	me	a	note.”

_Oh,	thank	God	thank	God	thank	God._ 	She	didn’t	hightail	it	to
Oregon	in	a	drug-induced	haze.	“Yes.	Yes,	I	did.”

**Cooper**

**Saturday,	November	3,	3:15	p.m.**

It’s	hard	to	evaluate	exhibition	games	anymore,	but	overall	this	one
went	pretty	well.	My	fastball	hit	ninety-four,	I	struck	out	the	side	twice,
and	only	a	few	guys	heckled	me	from	the	stands.	They	were	wearing
tutus	and	baseball	caps,	though,	so	they	stood	out	a	little	more	than
your	average	gay	basher	before	security	escorted	them	out.

A	couple	of	college	scouts	showed	up,	and	the	guy	from	Cal	State
even	bothered	to	talk	to	me	afterward.	Coach	Ruffalo	started	hearing
from	teams	again,	but	it	strikes	me	as	more	of	a	PR	play	than	genuine
interest.	Only	Cal	State	is	still	talking	scholarship,	even	though	I’m
pitching	better	than	ever.	That’s	life	as	an	outed	murder	suspect,	I
guess.	Pop	doesn’t	wait	for	me	outside	the	locker	room	anymore.	He


heads	straight	for	the	car	when	I’m	done	and	starts	the	engine	so	we
can	make	a	quick	exit.

Reporters	are	another	story.	They’re	dying	to	talk	to	me.	I	brace
myself	when	a	camera	lights	up	as	I	leave	the	locker	room,	waiting	for
the	woman	with	the	microphone	to	cycle	through	the	usual	half-dozen
questions.	But	she	catches	me	by	surprise.

“Cooper,	what	do	you	think	about	Nate	Macauley’s	arrest?”
“Huh?”	 I	 stop	 short,	 too	 shocked	 to	 brush	 past	 her,	 and	 Luis
almost	bumps	into	me.

“You	 haven’t	 heard?”	 The	 reporter	 grins	 like	 I	 handed	 her	 a
winning	 lottery	 ticket.	 “Nate	 Macauley’s	 been	 arrested	 for	 Simon
Kelleher’s	murder,	and	the	Bayview	Police	are	saying	you’re	no	longer
a	person	of	interest.	Can	you	tell	me	how	that	feels?”

“Um...”	 _Nope.	I	can’t._ 	Or	won’t.	Same	difference.	“Excuse	me.”
“The	hell?”	Luis	mutters	once	we’re	past	the	camera	gauntlet.	He
pulls	out	his	phone	and	swipes	wildly	as	I	spot	my	father’s	car.	“Damn,
she	wasn’t	lying.	 _Dude._ ”	He	stares	at	me	with	wide	eyes.	“You’re	off	the
hook.”

Weird,	but	that	hadn’t	even	occurred	to	me	till	he	said	it.
We’re	giving	Luis	a	ride	home,	which	is	good	since	it	cuts	down
the	time	Pop	and	I	need	to	spend	alone.	Luis	and	I	drop	our	bags	in	the
backseat,	and	I	climb	into	the	passenger	seat	while	Luis	settles	himself
into	 the	 back.	 Pop’s	 fiddling	 with	 the	 radio,	 trying	 to	 find	 a	 news
station.	 “They	 arrested	 that	 Macauley	 kid,”	 he	 says	 with	 grim
satisfaction.	“I’ll	tell	you	what,	they’re	gonna	have	a	pack	of	lawsuits	on
their	hands	when	this	is	done.	Starting	with	me.”

He	slides	his	eyes	to	my	left	as	I	sit.	That’s	Pop’s	new	thing:	he
looks	 _near_ 	me.	He	hasn’t	met	my	eyes	once	since	I	told	him	about	Kris.

“Well,	you	had	to	figure	it	was	Nate,”	Luis	says	calmly.	Throws
Nate	right	under	the	bus,	like	he	hadn’t	been	sitting	with	the	guy	at
lunch	all	last	week.

I	don’t	know	what	to	think.	If	I’d	had	to	point	a	finger	at	someone
when	this	all	started,	it	would’ve	been	Nate.	Even	though	he’d	acted
genuinely	desperate	when	he	was	searching	for	Simon’s	EpiPen.	He
was	the	person	I	knew	the	least,	and	he	was	already	a	criminal,	so...it


wasn’t	much	of	a	stretch.

But	when	the	entire	Bayview	High	cafeteria	was	ready	to	take	me
down	 like	 a	 pack	 of	 hyenas,	 Nate	 was	 the	 only	 person	 who	 said
anything.	I	never	thanked	him,	but	I’ve	thought	a	lot	about	how	much
worse	school	would’ve	gotten	if	he’d	brushed	past	me	and	let	things
snowball.

My	phone’s	filled	with	text	messages,	but	the	only	ones	I	care
about	are	a	string	from	Kris.	Other	than	a	quick	visit	to	warn	Kris
about	the	police	and	apologize	for	the	oncoming	media	onslaught,	I’ve
barely	seen	him	in	the	past	couple	of	weeks.	Even	though	people	know
about	us,	we	haven’t	had	a	chance	to	be	normal.

I’m	still	not	sure	what	that	would	even	look	like.	I	wish	I	could
find	out.

_Omg	saw	the	news
This	is	good	right??
Call	when	you	can_
I	text	him	back	while	half	listening	to	Pop	and	Luis	talk.	After	we
drop	Luis	off	silence	settles	between	me	and	my	father,	dense	as	fog.
I’m	the	first	to	break	it.	“So	how’d	I	do?”

“Good.	Looked	good.”	Bare-minimum	response,	as	usual	lately.
I	try	again.	“I	talked	to	the	scout	from	Cal	State.”
He	snorts.	“ _Cal	State._ 	Not	even	top	ten.”
“Right,”	I	acknowledge.
We	catch	sight	of	the	news	vans	when	we’re	halfway	down	our
street.	“Goddamn	it,”	Pop	mutters.	“Here	we	go	again.	Hope	this	was
worth	it.”

“What	was	worth	it?”
He	pulls	around	a	news	van,	throws	the	gearshift	into	park,	and
yanks	the	key	out	of	the	ignition.	“Your	 _choice._ ”

Anger	flares	inside	me—at	both	his	words	and	how	he	spits	them
out	without	even	looking	at	me.	“None	of	this	is	a	choice,”	I	say,	but	the
noise	outside	swallows	my	words	as	he	opens	the	door.

```
The	reporter	gauntlet	is	thinner	than	usual,	so	I’m	guessing	most
```

of	them	are	at	Bronwyn’s.	I	follow	Pop	inside,	where	he	immediately
heads	for	the	living	room	and	turns	on	the	TV.	I’m	supposed	to	do
postgame	stretching	now,	but	my	father	hasn’t	bothered	to	remind	me
about	my	routine	for	a	while.

Nonny’s	in	the	kitchen,	making	buttered	toast	with	brown	sugar
on	top.	“How	was	the	game,	darlin’?”

“Fantastic,”	I	say	heavily,	collapsing	into	a	chair.	I	pick	up	a	stray
quarter	 and	 spin	 it	 into	 a	 silvery	 blur	 across	 the	 kitchen	 table.	 “I
pitched	great,	but	nobody	cares.”

“Now,	now.”	She	sits	across	from	me	with	her	toast	and	offers	me
a	slice,	but	I	push	it	back	toward	her.	“Give	it	time.	Do	you	remember
what	I	told	you	in	the	hospital?”	I	shake	my	head.	“Things’ll	get	worse
before	they	get	better.	Well,	they	surely	did	get	worse,	and	now	there’s
nowhere	to	go	but	up.”	She	takes	a	bite	and	I	keep	spinning	the	quarter
until	she	swallows.	“You	should	bring	that	boy	of	yours	by	sometime
for	dinner,	Cooper.	It’s	about	time	we	met	him.”

I	 try	 to	 picture	 my	 father	 making	 conversation	 with	 Kris	 over
chicken	casserole.	“Pop	would	hate	that.”

“Well,	he’ll	have	to	get	used	to	it,	won’t	he?”
Before	 I	 can	 answer	 her,	 my	 phone	 buzzes	 with	 a	 text	 from	 a
number	 I	 don’t	 recognize.	 _It’s	 Bronwyn.	 I	 got	 your	 number	 from
Addy.	Can	I	call	you?_

_Sure._
My	phone	rings	within	seconds.	“Hi,	Cooper.	You’ve	heard	about
Nate?”

“Yeah.”	I’m	not	sure	what	else	to	say,	but	Bronwyn	doesn’t	give	me
a	chance.

“I’m	 trying	 to	 set	 up	 a	 meeting	 with	 Nate’s	 mom	 and	 Eli
Kleinfelter	from	Until	Proven.	I’m	hoping	he’ll	take	Nate’s	case.	I	was
wondering,	did	you	get	a	chance	to	ask	Luis’s	brother	about	that	red
Camaro	from	the	parking	lot	accident?”

“Luis	called	him	last	week	about	it.	He	was	gonna	look	into	it,	but
I	haven’t	heard	back	yet.”

```
“Would	you	mind	checking	in	with	him?”	Bronwyn	asks.
I	hesitate.	Even	though	I	haven’t	processed	everything	yet,	there’s
```

this	little	ball	of	relief	growing	inside	me.	Because	yesterday	I	was	the
police’s	number	one	guy.	And	today	I’m	not.	I’d	be	lying	if	I	said	it
didn’t	feel	good.

But	this	is	Nate.	Who’s	not	a	friend,	exactly.	Or	at	all,	I	guess.	But
he’s	not	nothing.

```
“Yeah,	okay,”	I	tell	Bronwyn.
```

**Bronwyn**

**Sunday,	November	4,	10:00	a.m.**

We’re	quite	the	crew	at	the	Until	Proven	offices	Sunday	morning:	me,
Mrs.	Macauley,	and	my	mom.	Who	was	willing	to	let	me	go,	but	not
unsupervised.

The	small,	sparsely	furnished	space	is	overflowing,	with	each	desk
holding	at	least	two	people.	Everyone’s	either	talking	urgently	on	the
phone	or	pounding	away	on	a	computer.	Sometimes	both.	“Busy	for	a
Sunday,”	I	comment	as	Eli	leads	us	into	a	tiny	room	crammed	with	a
small	table	and	chairs.

Eli’s	 hair	 seems	 to	 have	 grown	 three	 inches	 since	 he	 was	 on
_Mikhail	Powers	Investigates,_ 	all	of	it	upward.	He	runs	a	hand	through
the	 mad	 scientist	 curls	 and	 sends	 them	 even	 higher.	 “Is	 it	 Sunday
already?”

There	aren’t	enough	chairs,	so	I	sit	on	the	floor.	“Sorry,”	Eli	says.
“We	can	make	this	quick.	First	off,	Mrs.	Macauley,	I’m	sorry	about
your	 son’s	 arrest.	 I	 understand	 he’s	 been	 remanded	 to	 a	 juvenile
detention	center	instead	of	an	adult	facility,	which	is	good	news.	As	I
told	Bronwyn,	there’s	not	much	I	can	do	given	my	current	workload.
But	if	you’re	willing	to	share	whatever	information	you	have,	I’ll	do
what	I	can	to	provide	suggestions	and	maybe	a	referral.”

Mrs.	Macauley	looks	exhausted,	but	like	she’s	made	an	effort	to
dress	up	a	little	in	navy	pants	and	a	lumpy	gray	cardigan.	My	own
mother	is	her	usual	effortless	chic	in	leggings,	tall	boots,	a	cashmere
sweater-coat,	and	a	subtly	patterned	infinity	scarf.	The	two	of	them
couldn’t	be	more	different,	and	Mrs.	Macauley	tugs	at	the	frayed	hem
of	her	sweater	as	though	she	knows	it.

“Well.	Here’s	what	I’ve	been	told,”	she	says.	“The	school	received	a
call	that	Nate	had	drugs	in	his	locker—”


“From	whom?”	Eli	asks,	scribbling	on	a	yellow	notepad.
“They	 wouldn’t	 say.	 I	 think	 it	 was	 anonymous.	 But	 they	 went
ahead	and	removed	his	lock	Friday	after	school	to	check.	They	didn’t
find	any	drugs.	But	they	did	find	a	bag	with	Simon’s	water	bottle	and
EpiPen.	And	all	the	EpiPens	from	the	nurse’s	office	that	went	missing
the	day	he	died.”	I	run	my	fingers	along	the	rough	fiber	of	the	rug,
thinking	of	all	the	times	Addy’s	been	questioned	about	those	pens.
Cooper,	too.	They’ve	been	hanging	over	our	heads	for	weeks.	There’s
no	way,	even	if	Nate	were	actually	guilty	of	something,	that	he’d	be
dumb	enough	to	leave	them	sitting	in	his	locker.

“Ah.”	Eli’s	voice	comes	out	like	a	sigh,	but	his	head	stays	bent	over
his	legal	pad.

“So	the	police	got	involved,	and	they	got	a	warrant	to	search	the
house	Saturday	morning,”	Mrs.	Macauley	continues.	“And	they	found	a
computer	in	Nate’s	closet	with	this...journal,	I	guess	they’re	calling	it.
All	those	Tumblr	posts	that	have	been	popping	up	everywhere	since
Simon	died.”

I	raise	my	eyes	and	catch	my	mother	staring	at	me,	a	kind	of
disturbed	pity	crawling	across	her	face.	I	hold	her	gaze	and	shake	my
head.	I	don’t	believe	any	of	it.

“Ah,”	 Eli	 says	 again.	 This	 time	 he	 does	 look	 up,	 but	 his	 face
remains	calm	and	neutral.	“Any	fingerprints?”

“No,”	Mrs.	Macauley	says,	and	I	exhale	quietly.
“What	does	Nate	say	about	all	this?”	Eli	asks.
“That	he	has	no	idea	how	any	of	these	things	got	into	his	locker	or
the	house,”	Mrs.	Macauley	says.

“Okay,”	Eli	says.	“And	Nate’s	locker	hadn’t	been	searched	before
this?”

“I	don’t	know,”	Mrs.	Macauley	admits,	and	Eli	looks	at	me.
“It	was,”	I	recall.	“Nate	says	he	was	searched	the	first	day	they
questioned	us.	His	locker	and	his	house.	The	police	came	with	dogs
and	everything,	looking	for	drugs.	They	didn’t	find	any,”	I	add	hastily,
with	a	sideways	glance	at	my	mother	before	I	turn	back	to	Eli.	“But
nobody	found	Simon’s	things	or	a	computer	then.”

```
“Is	your	house	typically	locked?”	Eli	asks	Mrs.	Macauley.
```

“It’s	never	locked,”	she	replies.	“I	don’t	think	the	door	even	 _has_ 	a
lock	anymore.”

“Huh,”	Eli	mutters,	scribbling	on	his	pad	again.
“There’s	 something	 else,”	 Mrs.	 Macauley	 says,	 and	 her	 voice
wavers.	“The	district	attorney	wants	Nate	moved	to	a	regular	prison.
They’re	saying	he’s	too	dangerous	to	be	in	a	juvenile	center.”

A	chasm	cracks	open	in	my	chest	as	Eli	sits	bolt	upright.	It’s	the
first	time	he’s	dropped	his	impartial	lawyer	mask	and	shown	some
emotion,	and	the	horror	on	his	face	terrifies	me.	“Oh	no.	No,	no,	no.
That	 would	 be	 a	 fucking	 disaster.	 Excuse	 my	 language.	 What’s	 his
lawyer	doing	to	stop	that?”

“We	 haven’t	 met	 him	 yet.”	 Mrs.	 Macauley	 sounds	 near	 tears.
“Someone’s	been	appointed,	but	they	haven’t	been	in	touch.”

Eli	drops	his	pen	with	a	frustrated	grunt.	“Possession	of	Simon’s
things	isn’t	great.	Not	great	at	all.	People	have	been	convicted	on	less.
But	the	way	they	got	this	evidence...I	don’t	like	it.	Anonymous	tips,
things	 that	 weren’t	 there	 before	 conveniently	 showing	 up	 now.	 In
places	that	aren’t	hard	to	access.	Combination	locks	are	easy	to	pick.
And	if	the	DA’s	talking	about	sending	Nate	to	federal	prison	at	age
seventeen...any	lawyer	worth	a	damn	should	be	blocking	the	hell	out	of
that.”	He	rubs	a	hand	across	his	face	and	scowls	at	me.	“Damn	it,
Bronwyn.	This	is	your	fault.”

Everything	Eli’s	been	saying	has	been	making	me	more	and	more
sick,	except	this.	Now	I’m	just	confused.	“What	did	 _I_ 	do?”	I	protest.

“You	brought	this	case	to	my	attention	and	now	I	have	to	take	it.
And	I	 _do	not_ 	have	time.	But	whatever.	That’s	assuming	you’re	open	to
a	change	in	counsel,	Mrs.	Macauley?”

_Oh,	thank	God._ 	The	relief	surging	through	me	makes	me	limp	and
almost	dizzy.	Mrs.	Macauley	nods	vigorously,	and	Eli	sighs.

“I	can	help,”	I	say	eagerly.	“We’ve	been	looking	into—”	I’m	about
to	tell	Eli	about	the	red	Camaro,	but	he	holds	his	hand	out	with	a
forbidding	expression.

“Stop	right	there,	Bronwyn.	If	I’m	going	to	represent	Nate,	I	can’t
speak	 with	 other	 represented	 people	 in	 this	 case.	 It	 could	 get	 me
disbarred	and	put	you	at	risk	of	implication.	In	fact,	I	need	you	and
your	 mother	 to	 leave	 so	 I	 can	 work	 out	 some	 details	 with	 Mrs.


Macauley.”

“But...”	I	look	helplessly	at	my	mother,	who’s	nodding	and	getting
to	her	feet,	securing	her	handbag	over	her	shoulder	with	an	air	of
finality.

“He’s	 right,	 Bronwyn.	 You	 need	 to	 leave	 things	 with	 Mr.
Kleinfelter	and	Mrs.	Macauley	now.”	Her	expression	softens	as	she
meets	Mrs.	Macauley’s	eyes.	“I	wish	you	the	best	of	luck	with	all	this.”

“Thank	you,”	Mrs.	Macauley	says.	“And	thank	 _you,_ 	Bronwyn.”
I	should	feel	good.	Mission	accomplished.	But	I	don’t.	Eli	doesn’t
know	half	of	what	we	do,	and	now	how	am	I	supposed	to	tell	him?

**Addy**

**Monday,	November	5,	6:30	p.m.**

By	 Monday	 things	 have	 gotten	 oddly	 normal.	 Well,	 _new_ -normal.
Newmal?	Anyway,	my	point	is,	when	I	sit	down	to	dinner	with	my
mother	and	Ashton,	the	driveway	is	free	of	news	vans	and	my	lawyer
doesn’t	call	once.

Mom	deposits	a	couple	of	heated-up	Trader	Joe’s	dinners	in	front
of	Ashton	and	me,	then	sits	between	us	with	a	cloudy	glass	of	yellow-
brown	 beverage.	 “I’m	 not	 eating,”	 she	 announces,	 even	 though	 we
didn’t	ask.	“I’m	cleansing.”

Ashton	wrinkles	her	nose.	“Ugh,	Mom.	That’s	not	that	lemonade
with	the	maple	syrup	and	cayenne	pepper,	is	it?	That’s	so	gross.”

“You	can’t	argue	with	results,”	Mom	says,	taking	a	long	sip.	She
presses	a	napkin	to	her	overly	plumped	lips,	and	I	take	in	her	stiff
blond	hair,	red	lacquered	nails,	and	the	skintight	dress	she	put	on	for	a
typical	Monday.	Is	that	me	in	twenty-five	years?	The	thought	makes
me	even	less	hungry	than	I	was	a	minute	ago.

Ashton	turns	on	the	news	and	we	watch	coverage	of	Nate’s	arrest,
including	 an	 interview	 with	 Eli	 Kleinfelter.	 “Handsome	 boy,”	 Mom
notes	when	Nate’s	mug	shot	appears	on	the	screen.	“Shame	he	turned
out	to	be	a	murderer.”

I	push	my	half-eaten	tray	away.	There’s	no	point	in	suggesting	that
the	 police	 might	 be	 wrong.	 Mom’s	 just	 happy	 the	 lawyer	 bills	 are
almost	over.

```
The	doorbell	rings,	and	Ashton	folds	her	napkin	next	to	her	plate.
```

“I’ll	see	who	it	is.”	She	calls	my	name	a	few	seconds	later,	and	my
mother	 shoots	 me	 a	 surprised	 look.	 Nobody’s	 come	 to	 the	 door	 in
weeks	unless	they	wanted	to	interview	me,	and	my	sister	always	chases
those	away.	Mom	follows	me	into	the	living	room	as	Ashton	pulls	the
door	open	to	let	TJ	enter.

“Hey.”	I	blink	at	him	in	surprise.	“What	are	you	doing	here?”
“Your	history	book	ended	up	in	my	backpack	after	earth	science.
This	is	yours,	right?”	TJ	hands	a	thick	gray	textbook	to	me.	We’ve	been
lab	partners	since	the	first	rock	sorting,	and	it’s	usually	a	bright	spot	in
my	day.

“Oh.	Yeah,	thanks.	But	you	could’ve	given	it	to	me	tomorrow.”
“We	have	that	quiz,	though.”
“Right.”	 No	 point	 in	 telling	 him	 I’ve	 pretty	 much	 given	 up	 on
academics	for	the	semester.	“How’d	you	know	where	I	live?”

“School	directory.”	Mom’s	staring	at	TJ	like	he’s	dessert,	and	he
meets	her	eyes	with	a	polite	smile.	“Hi,	I’m	TJ	Forrester.	I	go	to	school
with	Addy.”	She	simpers	and	shakes	his	hand,	taking	in	his	dimples
and	football	jacket.	He’s	almost	a	dark-skinned,	crooked-nosed	version
of	Jake.	His	name	doesn’t	register	with	her,	but	Ashton	exhales	a	soft
breath	behind	me.

I’ve	 got	 to	 get	 TJ	 out	 of	 here	 before	 Mom	 puts	 two	 and	 two
together.	“Well,	thanks	again.	I’d	better	go	study.	See	you	tomorrow.”

“Do	you	want	to	study	together	for	a	while?”	TJ	asks.
I	hesitate.	I	like	TJ,	I	really	do.	But	spending	time	together	outside
school	isn’t	a	step	I’m	ready	to	take.	“I	can’t,	because	of...other	stuff.”	I
practically	shove	him	out	the	door,	and	when	I	turn	back	inside,	Mom’s
face	is	a	mixture	of	pity	and	irritation.

“What’s	 wrong	 with	 you?”	 she	 hisses.	 “Being	 so	 rude	 to	 a
handsome	boy	like	that!	It’s	not	as	if	they’re	beating	down	your	door
anymore.”	Her	eyes	flicker	over	my	purple-streaked	hair.	“Given	the
way	 you’ve	 let	 yourself	 go,	 you	 should	 consider	 yourself	 lucky	 he
wanted	to	spend	time	with	you	at	all.”

```
“God,	Mom—”	Ashton	says,	but	I	interrupt	her.
“I’m	not	looking	for	another	boyfriend,	Mom.”
She	stares	at	me	like	I’ve	sprouted	wings	and	started	speaking
```

Chinese.	“Why	on	earth	not?	It’s	been	ages	since	you	and	Jake	broke
up.”

“I	 spent	 more	 than	 three	 years	 with	 Jake.	 I	 could	 use	 some
downtime.”	I	say	it	mostly	to	argue,	but	as	soon	as	the	words	come	out
of	my	mouth	I	know	they’re	true.	My	mother	started	dating	when	she
was	fourteen,	like	me,	and	hasn’t	stopped	since.	Even	when	it	means
going	out	with	an	immature	man-boy	who’s	too	cowardly	to	bring	her
home	to	his	parents.

I	don’t	want	to	be	that	afraid	to	be	alone.
“Don’t	be	ridiculous.	That’s	the	last	thing	you	need.	Have	a	few
dates	with	a	boy	like	TJ,	even	if	you’re	not	interested,	and	other	boys	at
school	might	see	you	as	desirable	again.	You	don’t	want	to	end	up	on	a
shelf,	Adelaide.	Some	sad	single	girl	who	spends	all	her	time	with	that
odd	group	of	friends	you’ve	got	now.	If	you’d	wash	that	nonsense	out	of
your	hair,	grow	it	a	little,	and	wear	makeup	again,	you	could	do	 _much_
better	than	that.”

“I	don’t	need	a	guy	to	be	happy,	Mom.”
“Of	course	you	do,”	she	snaps.	“You’ve	been	miserable	for	the	past
month.”

“Because	I	was	being	investigated	for	murder,”	I	remind	her.	“Not
because	I’m	 _single._ ”	It’s	not	one	hundred	percent	true,	since	the	main
source	of	my	misery	was	Jake.	But	it	was	him	I	wanted	to	be	with.	Not
just	anyone.

My	 mother	 shakes	 her	 head.	 “You	 keep	 telling	 yourself
that,	Adelaide,	but	you’re	hardly	college	material.	Now’s	the	time	to
find	a	decent	boy	with	a	good	future	who’s	willing	to	take	care	of	y—”

“Mom,	 she’s	 _seventeen,_ ”	 Ashton	 interrupts.	 “You	 can	 put	 this
script	on	hold	for	at	least	ten	years.	Or	forever.	It’s	not	like	the	whole
relationship	thing	has	worked	out	well	for	either	of	us.”

“Speak	for	yourself,	Ashton,”	Mom	says	haughtily.	“Justin	and	I
are	ecstatically	happy.”

Ashton	opens	her	mouth	to	say	more,	but	my	phone	rings	and	I
hold	up	my	finger	as	Bronwyn’s	name	appears.	“Hey.	What’s	up?”	I
say.

```
“Hi.”	Her	voice	sounds	thick,	as	if	she’s	been	crying.	“So,	I	was
```

thinking	about	Nate’s	case	and	I	wanted	your	help	with	something.
Could	you	stop	by	for	a	little	while	tonight?	I’m	going	to	ask	Cooper,
too.”

It	 beats	 being	 insulted	 by	 my	 mother.	 “Sure.	 Text	 me	 your
address.”

I	scrape	my	half-eaten	dinner	into	the	garbage	disposal	and	grab
my	helmet,	calling	good-bye	to	Ashton	as	I	head	out	the	door.	It’s	a
perfect	late-fall	night,	and	the	trees	lining	our	street	sway	in	a	light
breeze	as	I	pedal	past.	Bronwyn’s	house	is	only	about	a	mile	from
mine,	 but	 it’s	 a	 completely	 different	 neighborhood;	 there’s	 nothing
cookie-cutter	about	these	houses.	I	coast	into	the	driveway	of	her	huge
gray	Victorian,	eyeing	the	vibrant	flowers	and	wraparound	porch	with
a	stab	of	envy.	It’s	gorgeous,	but	it’s	not	just	that.	It	looks	like	a	 _home._

When	I	ring	the	doorbell	Bronwyn	answers	with	a	muted	“Hey.”
Her	eyes	droop	with	exhaustion	and	her	hair’s	come	half	out	of	its
ponytail.	It	occurs	to	me	that	we’ve	all	had	our	turn	getting	crushed	by
this	experience:	me	when	Jake	dumped	me	and	all	my	friends	turned
against	me;	Cooper	when	he	was	outed,	mocked,	and	pursued	by	the
police;	and	now	Bronwyn	when	the	guy	she	loves	is	in	jail	for	murder.

Not	that	she’s	ever	said	she	loves	Nate.	It’s	pretty	obvious,	though.
“Come	 on	 in,”	 Bronwyn	 says,	 pulling	 the	 door	 open.	 “Cooper’s
here.	We’re	downstairs.”

She	leads	me	into	a	spacious	room	with	overstuffed	sofas	and	a
large	 flat-screen	 television	 mounted	 on	 the	 wall.	 Cooper	 is	 already
sprawled	in	an	armchair,	and	Maeve’s	sitting	cross-legged	in	another
with	her	laptop	on	the	armrest	between	them.	Bronwyn	and	I	sink	into
a	sofa	and	I	ask,	“How’s	Nate?	Have	you	seen	him?”

Wrong	 question,	 I	 guess.	 Bronwyn	 swallows	 once,	 then	 twice,
trying	to	keep	herself	together.	“He	doesn’t	want	me	to.	His	mom	says
he’s...okay.	Considering.	Juvenile	detention’s	horrible	but	at	least	it’s
not	prison.”	Yet.	We	all	know	Eli’s	locked	in	a	battle	to	keep	Nate
where	he	is.	“Anyway.	Thanks	for	coming.	I	guess	I	just...”	Her	eyes	fill
with	tears,	and	Cooper	and	I	exchange	a	worried	glance	before	she
blinks	them	back.	“You	know,	I	was	so	glad	when	we	all	finally	got
together	and	started	talking	about	this.	I	felt	a	lot	less	alone.	And	now	I
guess	I’m	asking	for	your	help.	I	want	to	finish	what	we	started.	Keep
putting	our	heads	together	to	make	sense	of	this.”


“I	haven’t	heard	anything	from	Luis	about	the	car,”	Cooper	says.
“I	wasn’t	actually	thinking	about	that	right	now,	but	please	keep
checking,	okay?	I	was	more	hoping	we	could	all	take	another	look	at
those	Tumblr	posts.	I	have	to	admit,	I	started	ignoring	them	because
they	were	freaking	me	out.	But	now	the	police	say	Nate	wrote	them,
and	 I	 thought	 we	 should	 read	 through	 and	 note	 anything	 that’s
surprising,	or	doesn’t	fit	with	how	we	remember	things,	or	just	strikes
us	as	weird.”	She	pulls	her	ponytail	over	her	shoulder	as	she	opens	her
laptop.	“Do	you	mind?”

“Now?”	Cooper	asks.
Maeve	angles	her	screen	so	Cooper	can	see	it.	“No	time	like	the
present.”

Bronwyn’s	next	to	me,	and	we	start	from	the	bottom	of	the	Tumblr
posts.	 _I	got	the	idea	for	killing	Simon	while	watching_ 	Dateline.	Nate’s
never	struck	me	as	a	newsmagazine	show	fan,	but	I	doubt	that’s	the
kind	of	insight	Bronwyn’s	looking	for.	We	sit	in	silence	for	a	while,
reading.	Boredom	creeps	in	and	I	realize	I’ve	been	skimming,	so	I	go
back	and	try	to	read	more	thoroughly.	 _Blah	blah,	I’m	so	smart,	nobody
knows	it’s	me,	the	police	don’t	have	a	clue._ 	And	so	on.

“Hang	on.	This	didn’t	happen.”	Cooper’s	reading	more	carefully
than	 I	 am.	 “Have	 you	 gotten	 to	 this	 yet?	 The	 one	 dated	 October
twentieth,	about	Detective	Wheeler	and	the	doughnuts?”

I	raise	my	head	like	a	cat	pricking	up	its	ears	at	a	distant	sound.
“Um,”	Bronwyn	says,	her	eyes	scanning	the	screen.	“Oh	yeah.	That’s	a
weird	little	aside,	isn’t	it?	We	were	never	all	at	the	police	station	at
once.	Well,	maybe	right	after	the	funeral,	but	we	didn’t	see	or	talk	to
each	other.	Usually	when	whoever’s	writing	these	throws	in	specific
details,	they’re	accurate.”

“What	are	you	guys	looking	at?”	I	ask.
Bronwyn	increases	the	page	size	and	points.	“There.	Second	to	last
line.”

```
This	investigation	is	turning	into	such	a	cliché,	the	four	of	us	even	caught
Detective	Wheeler	eating	a	pile	of	doughnuts	in	the	interrogation	room.
```
A	cold	wave	washes	over	me	as	the	words	enter	my	brain	and	nest
there,	pushing	everything	else	out.	Cooper	and	Bronwyn	are	right:	that


didn’t	happen.

```
But	I	told	Jake	it	did.
```

**Bronwyn**

**Tuesday,	November	6,	7:30	p.m.**

I’m	not	supposed	to	talk	to	Eli.	So	last	night	I	texted	Mrs.	Macauley	a
link	to	the	Tumblr	post	that	Addy,	Cooper,	and	I	read	together,	and
told	her	what	was	weird	about	it.	Then	I	waited.	A	frustratingly	long
time,	until	I	got	a	text	back	from	her	after	school.

_Thank	you.	I’ve	informed	Eli,	but	he	asks	that	you	don’t	involve
yourself	further._

That’s	all.	I	wanted	to	throw	my	phone	across	the	room.	I’ll	admit
it;	I	spent	most	of	last	night	fantasizing	that	Addy’s	bombshell	would
get	Nate	out	of	jail	immediately.	While	I	realize	that	was	ridiculously
naïve,	I	still	think	it	deserves	more	than	a	brush-off.

Even	though	I	can’t	wrap	my	brain	around	what	it	means.	Because
— _Jake	Riordan?_ 	If	I	had	to	pick	the	most	random	possible	person	to
be	involved	in	this,	it	still	wouldn’t	have	been	him.	And	involved	how,
exactly?	Did	he	write	the	whole	Tumblr,	or	just	that	one	post?	Did	he
frame	Nate?	Did	he	kill	Simon?

Cooper	shot	that	down	almost	immediately.	“He	couldn’t	have,”	he
said	Monday	night.	“Jake	was	at	football	practice	when	Addy	called
him.”

“He	might	have	left,”	I	insisted.	So	Cooper	called	Luis	to	confirm.
“Luis	says	no,”	Cooper	reported.	“Jake	was	leading	passing	drills	the
whole	time.”

I’m	 not	 sure	 we	 can	 hinge	 an	 entire	 investigation	 on	 Luis’s
memory,	though.	That	boy’s	killed	a	lot	of	brain	cells	over	the	years.	He
didn’t	even	question	why	Cooper	was	asking.

Now	I’m	in	my	room	with	Maeve	and	Addy,	putting	dozens	of
colored	Post-its	on	the	wall	that	summarize	everything	we	know.	It’s
very	 _Law	&	Order,_ 	except	none	of	it	makes	sense.


_Someone	planted	phones	in	our	backpacks
Simon	was	poisoned	during	detention
Bronwyn,	Nate,	Cooper,	Addy	&	Mr.	Avery	were	in	the	room
The	car	accident	distracted	us
Jake	wrote	at	least	one	Tumblr	post
Jake	and	Simon	were	friends	once
Leah	hates	Simon
Aiden	Wu	hates	Simon
Simon	had	a	thing	for	Keely
Simon	had	a	violence-loving	alter	ego	online
Simon	was	depressed
Janae	seems	depressed
Janae	&	Simon	stopped	being	friends?_
My	mother’s	voice	floats	up	the	stairs.	“Bronwyn,	Cooper’s	here.”
Mom	already	loves	Cooper.	So	much	that	she	doesn’t	protest	all	of
us	getting	together	again,	even	though	Robin’s	legal	advice	is	to	still
keep	our	distance	from	one	another.

“Hey,”	Cooper	says,	not	the	least	bit	breathless	from	bounding	up
our	stairs.	“I	can’t	stay	long,	but	I	got	some	good	news.	Luis	thinks	he
might’ve	found	that	car.	His	brother	called	a	buddy	at	a	repair	place	in
Eastland	 and	 they	 had	 a	 red	 Camaro	 come	 through	 with	 fender
damage	a	few	days	after	Simon	died.	I	got	you	the	license	plate	and	a
phone	number.”	He	searches	through	his	backpack	and	hands	me	a
torn	envelope	with	numbers	scrawled	across	the	back.	“I	guess	you	can
pass	that	along	to	Eli,	huh?	Maybe	there’s	something	there.”

“Thanks,”	I	say	gratefully.
Cooper	runs	his	eyes	over	my	wall.	“This	helping?”
Addy	 sits	 back	 on	 her	 haunches	 with	 a	 frustrated	 noise.	 “Not
really.	It’s	just	a	collection	of	random	facts.	Simon	this,	Janae	that,
Leah	this,	Jake	that...”

Cooper	frowns	and	crosses	his	arms,	leaning	forward	for	a	better
look	at	the	wall.	“I	don’t	get	the	Jake	part,	at	all.	I	can’t	believe	he’d


actually	 sit	 around	 and	 write	 that	 damn	 Tumblr.	 I	 think	 he	 just...
blabbed	to	the	wrong	person	or	something.”	He	taps	a	finger	on	the
Post-it	with	all	our	names	on	it.	“And	I	keep	wondering:	Why	 _us_?
Why’d	we	get	dragged	into	this?	Are	we	just	collateral	damage,	like
Nate	said?	Or	is	there	some	specific	reason	we’re	part	of	this?”

I	tilt	my	head	at	him,	curious.	“Like	what?”
Cooper	shrugs.	“I	don’t	know.	Take	you	and	Leah.	It’s	a	small
thing,	but	what	if	something	like	that	started	a	domino	effect?	Or	me
and...”	He	scans	the	wall	and	settles	on	a	Post-it.	“Aiden	Wu,	maybe.
He	got	outed	for	cross-dressing,	and	I	was	hiding	the	fact	I’m	gay.”

“But	that	entry	was	changed,”	I	remind	him.
“I	know.	And	that’s	weird	too,	isn’t	it?	Why	get	rid	of	a	perfectly
good	piece	of	gossip	that’s	true,	and	replace	it	with	one	that’s	not?	I
can’t	shake	the	feeling	that	this	is	 _personal,_ 	y’know?	The	way	that
Tumblr	kept	everything	going,	egging	people	on	about	us.	I	wish	I
understood	why.”

Addy	tugs	on	one	of	her	earrings.	Her	hand	trembles,	and	when
she	speaks,	her	voice	does	too.	“Things	were	pretty	personal	between
me	and	Jake,	I	guess.	And	maybe	he	was	jealous	of	you,	Cooper.	But
Bronwyn	and	Nate...why	would	he	involve	them?”

_Collateral	damage._ 	We’ve	all	been	affected,	but	Nate’s	gotten	the
worst	of	it	by	far.	If	Jake’s	to	blame,	that	doesn’t	make	sense.	But	then
again,	none	of	this	does.

“I	should	go,”	Cooper	says.	“I’m	meeting	Luis.”
I	manage	a	smile.	“Not	Kris?”
Cooper’s	 return	 smile	 is	 a	 little	 strained.	 “We’re	 still	 figuring
things	out.	Anyway,	let	me	know	if	the	car	stuff	is	helpful.”

He	leaves	and	Maeve	gets	up,	crossing	over	to	the	spot	near	my
bed	that	Cooper	just	vacated.	She	shuffles	Post-its	on	the	wall,	putting
four	of	them	into	a	square:

```
Jake	wrote	at	least	one	Tumblr	post
Leah	hates	Simon
Aiden	Wu	hates	Simon
Janae	seems	depressed
```

“These	are	the	most	connected	people.	They’ve	either	got	reason	to
hate	Simon,	or	we	already	know	they’re	involved	in	some	way.	Some
are	pretty	unlikely”—she	taps	on	Aiden’s	name—“and	some	have	big
red	flags	against	them.”	She	points	to	Jake	and	Janae.	“But	nothing’s
clear-cut.	What	are	we	missing?”

```
We	all	stare	at	the	Post-its	in	silence.
—
```
You	can	learn	a	lot	about	a	person	when	you	have	his	license	plate	and
phone	number.	His	address,	for	example.	And	his	name,	and	where	he
goes	to	school.	So	if	you	wanted	to,	you	could	hang	out	in	the	parking
lot	of	his	school	before	it	started	and	wait	for	his	red	Camaro	to	arrive.
Theoretically.

Or	actually.
I	 meant	 to	 turn	 the	 numbers	 Cooper	 gave	 me	 over	 to	 Mrs.
Macauley	so	she	could	pass	them	along	to	Eli.	But	I	kept	thinking
about	 her	 terse	 text:	 _I’ve	 informed	 Eli,	 but	 he	 asks	 that	 you	 don’t
involve	yourself	further._ 	Would	Eli	even	take	me	seriously?	He’s	the
one	 who	 first	 mentioned	 the	 car	 accident	 as	 suspicious,	 but	 he’s
spending	 all	 his	 time	 trying	 to	 keep	 Nate	 in	 the	 juvenile	 detention
center.	He	might	consider	this	nothing	but	a	pesky	distraction.

Anyway,	I’m	just	scoping	things	out.	That’s	what	I	tell	myself	as	I
enter	 Eastland	 High’s	 parking	 lot.	 They	 start	 classes	 forty	 minutes
before	we	do,	so	I	can	still	get	back	to	Bayview	in	plenty	of	time	for	the
first	bell.	It’s	stuffy	in	the	car,	and	I	lower	both	front-seat	windows	as	I
pull	into	an	empty	spot	and	turn	the	car	off.

Thing	is,	I	need	to	be	doing	stuff.	If	I	don’t,	I	think	about	Nate	too
much.	About	where	he	is,	what	he’s	going	through,	and	the	fact	that	he
won’t	talk	to	me.	I	mean,	I	understand	he	has	limited	communication
options.	Obviously.	But	they’re	not	nonexistent.	I	asked	Mrs.	Macauley
if	I	could	visit,	and	she	told	me	Nate	didn’t	want	me	there.

Which	stings.	She	thinks	he	wants	to	protect	me,	but	I’m	not	so
sure.	He’s	pretty	used	to	people	giving	up	on	him,	and	maybe	he’s
decided	to	do	it	to	me	first.

A	flash	of	red	catches	my	eye,	and	an	ancient	Camaro	with	a	shiny
fender	parks	a	few	spaces	away	from	me.	A	short	dark-haired	boy	gets
out	and	hauls	a	backpack	from	the	passenger	seat,	looping	one	strap


over	his	shoulder.

I	don’t	intend	to	say	anything.	But	he	glances	my	way	as	he	walks
by	my	window	and	before	I	can	stop	myself	I	blurt	out,	“Hey.”

He	pauses,	curious	brown	eyes	meeting	mine.	“Hey.	I	know	you.
You’re	the	girl	from	the	Bayview	investigation.	Bronte,	right?”

“Bronwyn.”	Since	I’ve	already	blown	my	cover,	might	as	well	go	all
in.

“What	are	you	doing	here?”	He’s	dressed	like	he’s	waiting	for	a
’90s	grunge	comeback,	in	a	flannel	shirt	over	a	Pearl	Jam	T-shirt.

“Um...”	My	eyes	skitter	to	his	car.	I	should	just	ask,	right?	That’s
what	I	came	for.	But	now	that	I’m	actually	talking	to	this	boy	the	whole
thing	seems	ridiculous.	What	am	I	supposed	to	say?	 _Hey,	what’s	the
deal	with	your	oddly	timed	car	accident	at	a	school	you	don’t	go	to?_
“Waiting	for	somebody.”

He	wrinkles	his	brow	at	me.	“You	know	people	here?”
“Yeah.”	 _Sort	of.	I	know	about	your	recent	car	repair,	anyway._
“Everybody’s	been	talking	about	you	guys.	Weird	case,	huh?	The
kid	who	died—he	was	kind	of	weird,	right?	I	mean,	who	even	has	an
app	 like	 that?	 And	 all	 that	 stuff	 they	 said	 on	 _Mikhail	 Powers._
Random.”

He	seems...nervous.	My	brain	chants	 _ask	ask	ask_ 	but	my	mouth
won’t	obey.

“Well.	See	ya.”	He	starts	to	move	past	my	car.
“Wait!”	My	voice	unsticks	and	he	pauses.	“Can	I	talk	to	you	for	a
second?”

“We	just	 _were_ 	talking.”
“Right,	but...I	have	an	actual	question	for	you.	The	thing	is,	when	I
said	I	was	waiting	for	somebody?	I	meant	you.”

He’s	definitely	nervous.	“Why	would	you	be	waiting	for	me?	You
don’t	even	know	me.”

“Because	of	your	car,”	I	say.	“I	saw	you	get	into	an	accident	in	our
parking	lot	that	day.	The	day	Simon	died.”

```
He	pales	and	blinks	at	me.	“How	do	you—why	do	you	think	that
```

was	me?”

“I	saw	your	license	plate,”	I	lie.	No	need	to	sell	out	Luis’s	brother.
“The	thing	is...the	timing	was	weird,	you	know?	And	now	someone’s
been	arrested	for	something	I’m	sure	he	didn’t	do	and	I	wondered...did
you	happen	to	see	anything	or	anyone	strange	that	day?	It	would	help
—”	My	voice	catches	and	tears	prick	my	eyes.	I	blink	them	back	and	try
to	focus.	“Anything	you	could	tell	me	would	help.”

He	hesitates	and	steps	back,	looking	toward	the	stream	of	kids
funneling	into	the	school.	I	wait	for	him	to	back	away	and	join	them,
but	instead	he	crosses	to	the	other	side	of	my	car,	opens	the	passenger
door,	and	climbs	inside.	I	press	a	button	to	raise	the	windows	and	turn
to	face	him.

“So.”	He	runs	a	hand	through	his	hair.	“This	is	weird.	I’m	Sam,	by
the	way.	Sam	Barron.”

“Bronwyn	Rojas.	But	I	guess	you	know	that	already.”
“Yeah.	I’ve	been	watching	the	news	and	wondering	if	I	should	say
something.	But	I	didn’t	know	if	it	meant	anything.	I	still	don’t.”	He
gives	 me	 a	 quick	 sideways	 glance,	 as	 though	 checking	 for	 signs	 of
alarm.	“We	didn’t	do	anything	wrong.	Like,	illegal.	As	far	as	I	know.”

My	spine	tingles	as	I	sit	up	straighter.	“Who’s	‘we’?”
“Me	and	my	buddy.	We	had	the	accident	on	purpose.	A	guy	paid
us	 a	 thousand	 bucks	 each	 to	 do	 it.	 Said	 it	 was	 a	 prank.	 I	 mean,
wouldn’t	you?	The	fender	barely	cost	five	hundred	to	fix.	The	rest	was
pure	profit.”

“Someone...”	It’s	warm	in	the	car	with	the	windows	up,	and	my
hands	gripping	the	steering	wheel	are	slick	with	sweat.	I	should	turn
the	air	conditioning	on,	but	I	can’t	move.	“Who?	Do	you	know	his
name?”

“I	didn’t,	but—”
“Did	he	have	brown	hair	and	blue	eyes?”	I	blurt	out.
“Yeah.”
_Jake._ 	He	must’ve	gotten	away	from	Luis	at	some	point	after	all.
“Was	he—	Wait,	I	have	a	picture	in	here	somewhere,”	I	say,	fumbling
through	my	backpack	for	my	phone.	I’m	sure	I	took	a	picture	of	the
homecoming	court	in	September.


“I	don’t	need	a	picture,”	Sam	says.	“I	know	who	he	is.”
“Really?	Like,	you	know	his	name?”	My	heart’s	beating	so	fast	I
can	see	my	chest	moving.	“Are	you	sure	he	gave	you	a	real	name?”

“He	didn’t	give	me	any	name.	I	figured	it	out	later	when	I	saw	the
news.”

I	remember	those	first	few	stories,	with	Jake’s	class	picture	next	to
Addy’s.	A	lot	of	people	thought	it	wasn’t	fair	to	show	him,	but	I’m	glad
they	did.	I	have	the	homecoming	picture	pulled	up	now,	and	I	hand	it
to	Sam.	“Him,	right?	Jake	Riordan?”

He	blinks	at	my	phone,	shakes	his	head,	and	hands	it	back.	“No.
That’s	not	him.	It	was	someone	a	lot	more...closely	involved	with	the
whole	thing.”

My	heart’s	about	to	explode.	If	it	wasn’t	Jake,	there’s	only	one
other	boy	with	dark	hair	and	blue	eyes	involved	in	the	investigation.
_Closely_ 	involved,	no	less.	And	that’s	Nate.

_No.	No.	Please,	God,	no._
“Who?”	My	voice	isn’t	even	a	whisper.
Sam	blows	out	a	sigh	and	leans	against	the	headrest.	He’s	quiet	for
the	longest	seconds	of	my	life	until	he	says,	“It	was	Simon	Kelleher.”


**Cooper**

**Wednesday,	November	7,	7:40	p.m.**

These	murder	club	meetings	are	becoming	a	regular	thing.	We	need	a
new	name,	though.

This	time	we’re	at	a	coffee	shop	in	downtown	San	Diego,	crammed
into	a	back	table	because	our	numbers	keep	expanding.	Kris	came	with
me,	and	Ashton	with	Addy.	Bronwyn’s	got	all	her	Post-it	notes	on	a
bunch	of	manila	folders,	including	the	newest	one:	 _Simon	paid	two
kids	to	stage	a	car	accident._ 	She	says	Sam	Barron	promised	to	call	Eli
and	let	him	know.	How	that’ll	help	Nate,	I	have	no	idea.

“Why’d	you	pick	this	place,	Bronwyn?”	Addy	asks.	“Kind	of	out	of
the	way.”

Bronwyn	 clears	 her	 throat	 and	 makes	 a	 big	 production	 of
rearranging	her	Post-it	notes.	“No	reason.	So,	anyway.”	She	shoots	a
businesslike	look	around	the	table.	“Thanks	for	coming.	Maeve	and	I
keep	going	over	this	stuff	and	it	never	makes	any	sense.	We	thought	a
meeting	of	the	minds	might	help.”

Maeve	and	Ashton	return	from	the	counter,	balancing	our	orders
on	a	couple	of	recyclable	trays.	They	hand	drinks	around,	and	I	watch
Kris	methodically	open	five	packets	of	sugar	and	dump	them	into	his
latte.	“What?”	he	asks,	catching	my	expression.	He’s	in	a	green	polo
shirt	that	brings	out	his	eyes,	and	he	looks	really,	really	good.	That	still
seems	like	the	kind	of	thing	I’m	not	supposed	to	notice.

“You	like	sugar,	huh?”	It’s	a	dumb	thing	to	say.	What	I	mean	is,	 _I
have	no	idea	how	you	take	your	coffee	because	this	is	the	first	time
we’ve	been	out	in	public	together._ 	Kris	presses	his	lips	together,	which
shouldn’t	 be	 attractive	 but	 is.	 I	 feel	 awkward	 and	 jittery	 and
accidentally	bump	his	knee	under	the	table.

```
“Nothing	wrong	with	that,”	Addy	says,	tipping	her	cup	against
```

Kris’s.	The	liquid	inside	hers	is	so	pale	it	barely	resembles	coffee.

Kris	and	I	have	been	spending	more	time	together,	but	it	doesn’t
feel	 natural	 yet.	 Maybe	 I’d	 gotten	 used	 to	 the	 sneaking	 around,	 or
maybe	I	haven’t	come	to	terms	with	the	fact	that	I’m	dating	a	guy.	I
found	myself	keeping	my	distance	from	Kris	when	we	walked	from	my
car	to	the	coffee	shop,	because	I	didn’t	want	people	guessing	what	we
are	to	each	other.

I	hate	that	part	of	me.	But	it’s	there.
Bronwyn	 has	 some	 kind	 of	 steaming	 tea	 that	 looks	 too	 hot	 to
drink.	She	pushes	it	aside	and	props	one	of	the	manila	folders	against
the	wall.	“Here’s	all	the	stuff	we	know	about	Simon:	He	was	going	to
post	rumors	about	us.	He	paid	two	kids	to	stage	a	car	accident.	He	was
depressed.	He	had	a	creepy	online	persona.	He	and	Janae	seemed	on
the	outs.	He	had	a	thing	for	Keely.	He	used	to	be	friends	with	Jake.	Am
I	missing	anything?”

“He	deleted	my	original	About	That	entry,”	I	say.
“Not	necessarily,”	Bronwyn	corrects.	“Your	entry	was	deleted.	We
don’t	know	by	whom.”

Fair	enough,	I	guess.
“And	here’s	what	we	know	about	Jake,”	Bronwyn	continues.	“He
wrote	at	least	one	of	the	Tumblr	posts,	or	helped	somebody	else	write
it.	He	wasn’t	in	the	school	building	when	Simon	died,	according	to
Luis.	He—”

“Is	a	complete	control	freak,”	Ashton	interrupts.	Addy	opens	her
mouth	in	protest,	but	Ashton	cuts	her	off.	“He	 _is,_ 	Addy.	He	ran	every
part	of	your	life	for	three	years.	Then	as	soon	as	you	did	something	he
didn’t	like,	he	blew	up.”	Bronwyn	scribbles	 _Jake	is	a	control	freak_ 	on	a
Post-it	with	an	apologetic	glance	at	Addy.

“It’s	a	data	point,”	Bronwyn	says.	“Now,	what	if—”
The	 front	 door	 bangs	 and	 she	 goes	 bright	 red.	 “What	 a
coincidence.”	I	follow	her	gaze	and	see	a	young	guy	with	wild	hair	and
a	scruffy	beard	enter	the	coffee	shop.	He	looks	familiar,	but	I	can’t
place	 him.	 He	 spots	 Bronwyn	 with	 an	 exasperated	 expression	 that
turns	alarmed	when	he	takes	in	Addy	and	me.

```
He	holds	a	hand	in	front	of	his	face.	“I	don’t	see	you.	Any	of	you.”
```

Then	he	catches	sight	of	Ashton	and	does	a	classic	double	take,	almost
tripping	over	his	feet.	“Oh,	hi.	You	must	be	Addy’s	sister.”

Ashton	blinks,	confused,	looking	between	him	and	Bronwyn.	“Do	I
know	you?”

“This	is	Eli	Kleinfelter,”	Bronwyn	says.	“He’s	with	Until	Proven.
Their	offices	are	upstairs.	He’s,	um,	Nate’s	lawyer.”

_“Who	cannot	talk	to	you,”_ 	Eli	says,	like	he	just	remembered.	He
gives	 Ashton	 a	 lingering	 look,	 but	 turns	 away	 and	 heads	 for	 the
counter.	Ashton	shrugs	and	blows	on	her	coffee.	I’m	sure	she’s	used	to
having	that	effect	on	guys.

Addy’s	eyes	are	round	as	she	watches	Eli’s	retreating	back.	“God,
Bronwyn.	I	can’t	believe	you	stalked	Nate’s	lawyer.”

Bronwyn	looks	almost	as	embarrassed	as	she	should	be,	taking	the
envelope	I’d	given	her	out	of	her	backpack.	“I	wanted	to	see	if	Sam
Barron	ever	got	in	touch,	and	pass	along	his	information	if	he	hadn’t.	I
thought	if	I	ran	into	Eli	casually,	he	might	talk	to	me.	Guess	not.”	She
darts	a	hopeful	look	at	Ashton.	“I	bet	he’d	talk	to	 _you,_ 	though.”

Addy	locks	her	hands	on	her	hips	and	juts	her	chin	in	outrage.
“You	can’t	pimp	out	my	sister!”

Ashton	smiles	wryly	and	holds	out	her	hand	for	the	envelope.	“As
long	as	it’s	for	a	good	cause.	What	am	I	supposed	to	say?”

“Tell	him	he	was	right—that	the	car	accident	at	Bayview	the	day
Simon	died	was	staged.	The	envelope	has	contact	information	for	the
boy	Simon	paid	to	do	it.”

Ashton	heads	for	the	counter,	and	we	all	sip	our	drinks	in	silence.
When	she	returns	a	minute	later,	the	envelope’s	still	in	her	hand.	“Sam
called	him,”	she	confirms.	“He	said	he’s	looking	into	it,	he	appreciates
the	information,	and	you	should	mind	your	fucking	business.	That’s	a
direct	quote.”

Bronwyn	looks	relieved	and	not	at	all	insulted.	“Thank	you.	That’s
good	news.	So,	where	were	we?”

“Simon	and	Jake,”	Maeve	says,	propping	her	chin	in	one	hand	as
she	gazes	at	the	two	manila	folders.	“They’re	connected.	But	how?”

“Excuse	 me,”	 Kris	 says	 mildly,	 and	 everyone	 looks	 at	 him	 like
they’d	forgotten	he	was	at	the	table.	Which	they	probably	had.	He’s


been	quiet	since	we	got	here.

Maeve	tries	to	make	up	for	it	by	giving	him	an	encouraging	smile.
“Yeah?”

“I	 wonder,”	 Kris	 says.	 His	 English	 is	 unaccented	 and	 almost
perfect,	with	just	a	little	formality	that	hints	he’s	from	someplace	else.
“There	has	always	been	so	much	focus	on	who	was	in	the	room.	That’s
why	the	police	originally	targeted	the	four	of	you.	Because	it	would	be
almost	impossible	for	anyone	who	wasn’t	in	the	room	to	kill	Simon.
Right?”

“Right,”	I	say.
“So.”	Kris	removes	two	Post-its	from	one	of	the	folders.	“If	the
killer	 wasn’t	 Cooper,	 or	 Bronwyn,	 or	 Addy,	 or	 Nate—and	 nobody
thinks	the	teacher	who	was	there	could	have	had	anything	to	do	with	it
—who	does	that	leave?”	He	layers	one	Post-it	on	top	of	the	other	on	the
wall	 next	 to	 the	 booth,	 then	 sits	 back	 and	 looks	 at	 us	 with	 polite
attentiveness.

_Simon	was	poisoned	during	detention
Simon	was	depressed_
We’re	all	silent	for	a	long	minute,	until	Bronwyn	exhales	a	small
gasp.	“I’m	the	omniscient	narrator,”	she	says.

“What?”	Addy	asks.
“That’s	what	Simon	said	before	he	died.	I	said	there	wasn’t	any
such	 thing	 in	 teen	 movies,	 and	 he	 said	 there	 was	 in	 life.	 Then	 he
drained	his	drink	in	one	gulp.”	Bronwyn	turns	and	calls	 _“Eli!”_ 	but	the
door’s	already	closing	behind	Nate’s	lawyer.

“So	you’re	saying...”	Ashton	stares	around	the	table	until	her	eyes
land	on	Kris.	“You	think	Simon	committed	 _suicide_ ?”	Kris	nods.	“But
why?	Why	like	 _that_ ?”

“Let’s	 go	 back	 to	 what	 we	 know,”	 Bronwyn	 says.	 Her	 voice	 is
almost	clinical,	but	her	face	is	flushed	brick	red.	“Simon	was	one	of
those	people	who	thought	he	should	be	at	the	center	of	everything,	but
wasn’t.	And	he	was	obsessed	with	the	idea	of	making	some	kind	of
huge,	violent	splash	at	school.	He	fantasized	about	it	all	the	time	on
those	4chan	threads.	What	if	this	was	his	version	of	a	school	shooting?
Kill	himself	and	take	a	bunch	of	students	down	with	him,	but	in	an


unexpected	 way.	 Like	 framing	 them	 for	 murder.”	 She	 turns	 to	 her
sister.	“What	did	Simon	say	on	4chan,	Maeve?	 _Do	something	original.
Surprise	me	when	you	take	out	a	bunch	of	lemming	assholes._ ”

Maeve	nods.	“Exact	quote,	I	think.”
I	think	about	how	Simon	died—choking,	panicked,	trying	to	catch
his	breath.	If	he	really	did	it	to	himself,	I	wish	more	than	ever	we’d
found	his	damn	EpiPen.	“I	think	he	regretted	it	at	the	end,”	I	say,	the
weight	of	the	words	settling	heavy	on	my	heart.	“He	looked	like	he
wanted	help.	If	he	could’ve	gotten	medication	in	time,	maybe	a	close
call	like	that	would’ve	jolted	him	into	being	a	different	kind	of	guy.”

Kris’s	hand	squeezes	mine	under	the	table.	Bronwyn	and	Addy
both	look	like	they’re	back	in	the	room	where	Simon	died,	horrified
and	stunned.	They	know	I’m	right.	Silence	descends	and	I	think	we
might	be	done	until	Maeve	looks	over	at	the	Post-it	wall	and	sucks	in
her	cheeks.

“But	how	does	Jake	fit	in?”	she	asks.
Kris	 hesitates	 and	 clears	 his	 throat,	 like	 he’s	 waiting	 for
permission	 to	 speak.	 When	 nobody	 protests	 he	 says,	 “If	 Jake	 isn’t
Simon’s	killer,	he	must	be	his	accomplice.	Someone	had	to	keep	things
going	after	Simon	died.”

He	meets	Bronwyn’s	eyes,	and	some	kind	of	understanding	passes
between	them.	They’re	the	brains	of	this	operation.	The	rest	of	us	are
just	trying	to	keep	up.	Kris’s	hand	pulled	away	from	mine	while	he	was
talking,	and	I	take	it	back.

“Simon	found	out	about	Addy	and	TJ,”	Bronwyn	says.	“Maybe
that’s	how	he	approached	Jake	in	the	first	place	to	get	his	help.	Jake
would’ve	wanted	revenge,	because	he—”

A	chair	scrapes	noisily	beside	me	as	Addy	pushes	herself	away
from	the	table.	“Stop,”	she	says	in	a	choked	voice,	her	purple-streaked
hair	falling	into	her	eyes.	“Jake	wouldn’t...He	couldn’t...”

“I	 think	 we’ve	 had	 enough	 for	 one	 night,”	 Ashton	 says	 firmly,
getting	to	her	feet.	“You	guys	keep	going,	but	we	need	to	get	home.”

“Sorry,	Addy,”	Bronwyn	says	with	a	chagrined	expression.	“I	got
carried	away.”

```
Addy	waves	a	hand.	“It’s	fine,”	she	says	unsteadily.	“I	just...can’t
```

right	now.”	Ashton	links	arms	with	her	until	they	get	to	the	door;	then
she	pulls	it	open	and	lets	Addy	slip	through	ahead	of	her.

Maeve	watches	them,	her	chin	in	her	hands.	“She	has	a	point.	The
whole	thing	sounds	impossible,	doesn’t	it?	And	even	if	we’re	right,	we
can’t	 prove	 anything.”	 She	 looks	 hopefully	 at	 Kris,	 as	 though	 she’s
willing	him	to	work	more	Post-it	magic.

Kris	shrugs	and	taps	the	colored	square	closest	to	him.	“Perhaps
there’s	one	person	remaining	who	knows	something	useful.”

_Janae	seems	depressed_
Bronwyn	and	Maeve	leave	around	nine,	and	Kris	and	I	don’t	stay
much	longer.	We	gather	up	the	table	debris	that’s	left	and	deposit	it	in
the	trash	can	next	to	the	exit.	We’re	both	quiet,	coming	off	one	of	the
weirdest	dates	in	history.

“Well,”	Kris	says,	pushing	through	the	door	and	pausing	on	the
sidewalk	 to	 wait	 for	 me.	 “That	 was	 interesting.”	 Before	 he	 can	 say
anything	else	I	grab	him	and	press	him	against	the	coffee	shop	wall,
my	fingers	digging	into	his	hair	and	my	tongue	sliding	between	his
teeth	in	a	deep,	wanting	kiss.	He	makes	a	sound	like	a	surprised	growl
and	 pulls	 me	 hard	 against	 his	 chest.	 When	 another	 couple	 exits
through	the	door	and	we	break	apart,	he	looks	dazed.

He	straightens	his	shirt	and	runs	a	hand	over	his	hair.	“Thought
you’d	forgotten	how	to	do	that.”

“I’m	sorry.”	My	voice	thickens	with	the	need	to	kiss	him	again.
“It’s	not	that	I	didn’t	want	to.	It’s	just—”

“I	know.”	Kris	laces	his	fingers	in	mine	and	holds	our	hands	up
like	a	question.	“Yes?”

```
“Yes,”	I	say,	and	we	start	down	the	sidewalk	together.
```

**Wednesday,	November	7,	11:30	p.m.**

So	here’s	how	you	deal	with	being	locked	up.

You	 keep	 your	 mouth	 shut.	 Don’t	 talk	 about	 your	 life	 or	 why
you’re	there.	Nobody	cares	unless	they	want	to	use	it	against	you.

You	don’t	take	shit	from	anyone.	Ever.	Juvenile	detention’s	not
_Oz,_ 	but	people	will	still	fuck	with	you	if	they	think	you’re	weak.


You	make	friends.	I	use	the	term	loosely.	You	identify	the	least
shitty	people	you	can	find	and	associate	with	them.	Moving	around	in	a
pack	is	useful.

You	don’t	break	rules,	but	you	look	the	other	way	when	someone
else	does.

You	work	out	and	watch	television.	A	lot.
You	stay	under	the	guards’	radar	as	much	as	possible.	Including
the	overly	friendly	woman	who	keeps	offering	to	let	you	make	calls
from	her	office.

You	don’t	complain	about	how	slowly	time	passes.	When	you’ve
been	arrested	for	a	capital	offense	and	you’re	four	months	away	from
your	eighteenth	birthday,	days	that	crawl	by	are	your	friends.

You	 come	 up	 with	 new	 ways	 to	 answer	 your	 lawyer’s	 endless
questions.	 _Yeah,	I	leave	my	locker	open	sometimes.	No,	Simon’s	never
been	 to	 my	 house.	 Yeah,	 we	 saw	 each	 other	 outside	 of	 school
sometimes.	The	last	time?	Probably	when	I	was	selling	him	weed.
Sorry,	we’re	not	supposed	to	talk	about	that,	are	we?_

You	don’t	think	about	what’s	outside.	Or	who.	Especially	if	she’s
better	off	forgetting	you	exist.


**Addy**

**Thursday,	November	8,	7:00	p.m.**

I	 keep	 reading	 through	 the	 About	 This	 Tumblr	 as	 if	 it’s	 going	 to
change.	 But	 it	 never	 does.	 Ashton’s	 words	 loop	 through	 my	 head:
_Jake’s	a	complete	control	freak._ 	She’s	not	wrong.	But	does	that	mean
the	rest	of	it	has	to	be	right?	Maybe	Jake	told	somebody	else	what	I
said,	and	they	wrote	it.	Or	maybe	it’s	all	just	a	coincidence.

Except.	A	memory	surfaces	from	the	morning	of	Simon’s	death,	so
seemingly	insignificant	that	it	hadn’t	crossed	my	mind	till	now:	Jake
pulling	my	backpack	off	my	shoulder	with	an	easy	grin	as	we	walked
down	the	hallway	together.	 _That’s	too	heavy	for	you,	baby.	I’ve	got	it._
He’d	never	done	that	before,	but	I	didn’t	question	him.	Why	would	I?

And	a	phone	that	wasn’t	mine	got	pulled	from	my	backpack	a	few
hours	later.

I’m	not	sure	what’s	worse—that	Jake	might	be	part	of	something
so	awful,	that	I	drove	him	to	it,	or	that	he’s	been	putting	on	an	act	for
weeks.

“His	 choice,	 Addy,”	 Ashton	 reminds	 me.	 “Plenty	 of	 people	 get
cheated	on	and	don’t	lose	their	minds.	Take	me,	for	example.	I	threw	a
vase	 at	 Charlie’s	 head	 and	 moved	 on.	 That’s	 a	 normal	 reaction.
Whatever’s	going	on	here	isn’t	your	fault.”

That	might	be	true.	But	it	doesn’t	 _feel_ 	true.
So	I’m	supposed	to	talk	to	Janae,	who	hasn’t	been	in	school	all
week.	 I	 tried	 texting	 her	 a	 few	 times	 after	 school	 and	 again	 after
dinner,	but	she	never	responded.	Finally,	I	decided	to	borrow	TJ’s	trick
—find	her	address	in	the	school	directory	and	just	show	up.	When	I
told	Bronwyn	she	offered	to	come	along,	but	I	thought	it’d	go	better
with	only	me.	Janae	never	warmed	up	to	Bronwyn	all	that	much.

```
Cooper	insists	on	driving	me	even	though	I	tell	him	he’ll	need	to
```

wait	in	the	car.	There’s	no	way	Janae’ll	open	up	about	anything	if	he’s
around.	“That’s	fine,”	he	says	as	he	pulls	across	the	street	from	Janae’s
faux-Tudor	house.	“Text	me	if	things	turn	weird.”

“Will	do,”	I	say,	giving	him	a	salute	as	I	close	the	door	and	cross
the	street.	There	aren’t	any	cars	in	Janae’s	driveway,	but	lights	are
burning	throughout	the	house.	I	ring	the	doorbell	four	times	with	no
answer,	glancing	back	at	Cooper	with	a	shrug	after	the	last	one.	I’m
about	 to	 give	 up	 when	 the	 door	 cracks	 and	 one	 of	 Janae’s	 black-
rimmed	eyes	stares	out	at	me.	“What	are	you	doing	here?”	she	asks.

“Checking	 on	 you.	 You	 haven’t	 been	 around	 and	 you’re	 not
answering	my	texts.	Are	you	all	right?”

“Fine.”	Janae	tries	to	close	the	door,	but	I	stick	my	foot	in	it	to
stop	her.

“Can	I	come	in?”	I	ask.
She	hesitates	but	releases	the	door	and	steps	back,	allowing	me	to
push	it	forward	and	enter.	When	I	get	a	good	look	at	her,	I	almost	gasp.
She’s	thinner	than	ever,	and	angry	red	hives	cover	her	face	and	neck.
She	scratches	at	them	self-consciously.	“What?	I’m	not	feeling	well.
Obviously.”

I	peer	down	the	hallway.	“Anyone	else	home?”
“No.	My	parents	are	out	to	dinner.	Look,	um,	no	offense,	but	do
you	have	some	reason	for	being	here?”

Bronwyn	coached	me	on	what	to	say.	I’m	supposed	to	start	with
small,	subtle	questions	about	where	Janae’s	been	all	week	and	how
she’s	feeling.	To	follow	up	on	the	thread	of	Simon’s	depression	and
encourage	her	to	tell	me	more.	As	a	last	resort,	I	can	maybe	talk	about
what	Nate’s	facing	as	the	DA’s	office	tries	to	send	him	to	an	honest-to-
God	prison.

I	don’t	do	any	of	that.	Instead	I	step	forward	and	hug	her,	cradling
her	scrawny	body	as	though	she’s	a	little	kid	who	needs	comforting.
She	feels	like	one,	all	weightless	bones	and	fragile	limbs.	She	stiffens,
then	slumps	against	me	and	starts	to	cry.

“Oh	my	God,”	she	says	in	a	thick,	raspy	voice.	“It’s	all	fucked	up.
Everything’s	so	massively	fucked	up.”

```
“Come	on.”	I	lead	her	to	the	living	room	sofa,	where	we	sit	and	she
```

cries	some	more.	Her	head	digs	awkwardly	into	my	shoulder	while	I
pat	her	hair.	It’s	stiff	with	product,	her	mouse-brown	roots	blending
into	shiny	blue-black	dye.

“Simon	did	this	to	himself,	didn’t	he?”	I	ask	carefully.	She	pulls
away	and	buries	her	head	in	her	hands,	rocking	back	and	forth.

“How	did	you	know?”	she	chokes	out.
_God._ 	It’s	true.	I	didn’t	fully	believe	it	till	now.
I’m	not	supposed	to	tell	her	everything.	I’m	actually	not	supposed
to	 tell	 her	 _anything,_ but	 I	 do.	 I	 can’t	 think	 how	 else	 to	 have	 this
conversation.	When	I	finish	she	rises	and	goes	upstairs	without	a	word.
I	wait	for	a	couple	of	minutes,	curling	one	hand	on	my	lap	and	using
the	other	to	tug	at	my	earring.	Is	she	calling	somebody?	Getting	a	gun
to	blow	my	head	off?	Slitting	her	wrists	to	join	Simon?

Just	when	I	think	I	might	have	to	go	after	her,	Janae	thuds	down
the	 stairs	 holding	 a	 thin	 sheaf	 of	 papers	 she	 thrusts	 toward	 me.
“Simon’s	manifesto,”	she	says	with	a	sour	twist	of	her	mouth.	“It’s
supposed	to	be	sent	to	the	police	a	year	from	now,	after	all	your	lives
are	completely	screwed.	So	everyone	would	know	he	pulled	it	off.”

```
The	papers	tremble	in	my	hand	as	I	read:
```
```
Here’s	the	first	thing	you	need	to	know:	I	hate	my	life	and
everything	in	it.
So	I	decided	to	get	the	hell	out.	But	not	go	quietly.
I	thought	a	lot	about	how	to	do	this.	I	could	buy	a	gun,
like	pretty	much	any	asshole	in	America.	Bar	the	doors
one	morning	and	take	out	as	many	Bayview	lemmings	as
I	have	bullets	for	before	turning	the	last	one	on	myself.
And	I’d	have	a	lot	of	bullets.
But	that’s	been	done	to	death.	It	doesn’t	have	the	same
impact	anymore.
I	want	to	be	more	creative.	More	unique.	I	want	my
suicide	to	be	talked	about	for	years.	I	want	imposters	to
try	to	imitate	me.	And	fail,	because	the	planning	this	takes
is	beyond	your	average	depressed	loser	with	a	death	wish.
You’ve	been	watching	it	unfold	for	a	year	now.	If	it’s
```

```
gone	 the	 way	 I	 hope,	 you	 have	 no	 clue	 what	 actually
happened.
```
I	look	up	from	the	papers.	“Why?”	I	ask,	bile	rising	in	my	throat.
“How	did	Simon	get	to	this	point?”

“He’d	been	depressed	for	a	while,”	Janae	says,	kneading	the	fabric
of	her	black	skirt	between	her	hands.	The	stacks	of	studded	bracelets
she	wears	on	both	arms	rattle	with	the	movement.	“Simon	always	felt
like	he	should	get	a	lot	more	respect	and	attention	than	he	did,	you
know?	But	he	got	really	bitter	about	it	this	year.	He	started	spending
all	his	time	online	with	a	bunch	of	creepers,	fantasizing	about	getting
revenge	 on	 everyone	 who	 made	 him	 miserable.	 It	 got	 to	 the	 point
where	I	don’t	think	he	even	knew	what	was	real	anymore.	Whenever
something	bad	happened,	he	blew	it	way	out	of	proportion.”

Words	are	tumbling	out	of	her	now.	“He	started	talking	about
killing	himself	and	taking	people	with	him,	but,	like,	 _creatively._ 	He	got
obsessed	with	the	idea	of	using	the	app	to	frame	everyone	he	hated.	He
knew	 Bronwyn	 cheated	 and	 it	 pissed	 him	 off.	 She	 practically	 had
valedictorian	sewn	up	anyway,	but	she	made	it	impossible	for	him	to
catch	up.	He	thought	she’d	screwed	him	out	of	going	to	the	Model	UN
finals	too.	And	he	couldn’t	stand	Nate	because	of	what	happened	with
Keely.	Simon	had	thought	he	had	a	shot	with	her,	and	then	Nate	stole
her	away	without	even	trying	or	actually	giving	a	fuck.”

My	 heart	 contracts.	 God,	 poor	 Nate.	 What	 a	 stupid,	 pointless
reason	to	end	up	in	jail.	“What	about	Cooper?	Did	Simon	involve	him
because	of	Keely	too?”

Janae	snorts	out	a	bitter	laugh.	“Mr.	Nice	Guy?	Cooper	got	Simon
blacklisted	from	Vanessa’s	after-prom	party.	Even	though	Simon	was
on	the	court	and	everything.	He	was	 _so_ 	humiliated	that	he	was	not	only
not	invited,	but	actually	not	even	allowed	to	go.	 _Everyone_ 	was	going	to
be	there,	he	said.”

“ _Cooper_ did?”	 I	 blink.	 That’s	 news	 to	 me.	 Cooper	 hadn’t
mentioned	it,	and	I	never	even	noticed	Simon	wasn’t	there.

Which	I	guess	was	part	of	the	problem.
Janae	bobs	her	head.	“Yeah.	I	don’t	know	why,	but	he	did.	So
those	three	were	Simon’s	targets,	and	he	had	his	gossip	all	lined	up.	I
still	thought	it	was	just	talk,	though.	A	way	to	blow	off	steam.	Maybe	it


would’ve	been,	if	I	could	have	convinced	him	to	get	offline	and	stop
obsessing.	 But	 then	 Jake	 found	 out	 something	 Simon	 didn’t	 want
anyone	to	know	and	it	just—that	was	the	final	straw.”

_Oh	no._ 	Every	second	that	went	by	without	a	mention	of	Jake’s
name	 made	 me	 hope	 he	 wasn’t	 involved,	 after	 all.	 “What	 do	 you
mean?”	I	pull	at	my	earring	so	hard,	I’m	in	danger	of	tearing	a	lobe.

Janae	picks	at	her	chipped	nail	polish,	sending	gray	flakes	across
her	skirt.	“Simon	rigged	the	votes	so	he’d	be	on	the	junior	prom	court.”
My	hand	freezes	at	my	ear	and	my	eyes	go	wide.	Janae	huffs	out	a
humorless	little	laugh.	“I	know.	Stupid,	right?	Simon	was	weird	like
that.	He’d	make	fun	of	people	for	being	lemmings,	but	he	still	wanted
the	same	things	they	did.	And	he	wanted	them	to	look	up	to	him.	So	he
did	it,	and	he	was	gloating	about	it	at	the	pool	last	summer,	saying	how
easy	 it	 was	 and	 how	 he’d	 mess	 with	 homecoming	 too.	 And	 Jake
overheard	us.”

I	can	immediately	picture	Jake’s	reaction,	so	Janae’s	next	words
don’t	 surprise	 me.	 “He	 laughed	 his	 head	 off.	 Simon	 freaked.	 He
couldn’t	 stand	 the	 thought	 of	 Jake	 telling	 people,	 and	 everyone	 at
school	knowing	he’d	done	something	so	pathetic.	Like,	he’d	spent	years
spilling	everybody’s	secrets,	and	now	he	was	gonna	get	humiliated	with
one	of	his	own.”	She	cringes.	“Can	you	imagine?	The	creator	of	About
That	getting	exposed	as	such	a	wannabe?	It	sent	him	over	the	edge.”

“The	edge?”	I	echo.
“Yeah.	Simon	decided	to	stop	talking	about	his	crazy	plan	and
actually	 _do_ 	it.	He	already	knew	about	you	and	TJ,	but	he’d	been	sitting
on	that	till	school	started	again.	So	he	used	it	to	shut	Jake	up	and	bring
him	in.	Because	Simon	needed	somebody	to	keep	things	going	after	he
died,	and	I	wouldn’t	do	it.”

I	don’t	know	whether	to	believe	her	or	not.	“You	wouldn’t?”
“No,	I	wouldn’t.”	Janae	doesn’t	meet	my	eyes.	“Not	for	 _your_ 	sake.
I	didn’t	care	about	any	of	you.	For	Simon’s	sake.	But	he	wouldn’t	listen
to	me,	and	then	all	of	a	sudden	he	didn’t	need	me.	He	knew	what	Jake
was	like,	that	he’d	lose	it	when	he	found	out	about	you	and	TJ.	Simon
told	Jake	he	could	plant	everything	on	you	so	you’d	take	the	fall	and
wind	up	in	jail.	And	Jake	was	totally	on	board.	He	even	came	up	with
the	idea	of	sending	you	to	the	nurse’s	office	that	day	for	Tylenol	so
you’d	look	more	guilty.”


White	noise	buzzes	through	my	brain.	“The	perfect	revenge	for
cheating	on	a	perfect	boyfriend.”	I’m	not	sure	I’ve	said	it	out	loud	until
Janae	nods.

“Right,	and	no	one	would	ever	guess	since	Simon	and	Jake	weren’t
even	friends.	For	Simon,	there	was	the	added	bonus	that	he	didn’t	care
if	Jake	screwed	up	and	got	caught.	He	was	almost	hoping	he	would.
He’d	hated	Jake	for	years.”

Janae’s	voice	rises	like	she’s	warming	up	for	the	kind	of	bitch
session	she	and	Simon	probably	used	to	have	all	the	time.	“The	way
Jake	 just	 dropped	 Simon	 freshman	 year.	 Started	 hanging	 out	 with
Cooper	like	they’d	always	been	best	friends,	as	if	Simon	didn’t	exist
anymore.	Like	he	didn’t	 _matter._ ”

Saliva	swims	at	the	back	of	my	throat.	I’m	going	to	throw	up.	No,
pass	out.	Maybe	both.	Either	would	be	better	than	sitting	here	listening
to	this.	All	that	time	after	Simon	died,	when	Jake	comforted	me,	made
me	drive	to	a	party	with	TJ	like	nothing	happened,	 _slept_ 	with	me—he
knew.	He	knew	I’d	cheated	and	he	was	just	biding	his	time.	Waiting	to
punish	me.

That	might	be	the	worst	part.	How	 _normal_ 	he	acted	the	whole
time.

Somehow,	I	find	my	voice.	“But	he...But	 _Nate_ 	was	framed.	Did
Jake	change	his	mind?”

It	hurts	how	much	I	want	that	to	be	true.
Janae	doesn’t	answer	right	away.	The	room’s	silent	except	for	her
ragged	breathing.	“No,”	she	says	finally.	“The	thing	is...it	all	unfolded
almost	 exactly	 the	 way	 Simon	 planned.	 He	 and	 Jake	 snuck	 those
phones	into	your	backpacks	that	morning,	and	Mr.	Avery	found	them
and	gave	you	detention,	just	like	Simon	said	he	would.	He	made	it	easy
for	the	police	to	investigate	by	keeping	the	About	That	admin	site	wide
open.	He	wrote	an	outline	of	the	Tumblr	journal,	and	told	Jake	to	post
updates	 from	 public	 computers	 with	 details	 about	 what	 was	 really
happening.	It	was	like	watching	some	out-of-control	reality	TV	show
where	you	keep	thinking	producers	are	gonna	step	in	and	say,	 _Enough._
But	nobody	did.	It	made	me	sick.	I	kept	telling	Jake	he	needed	to	stop
before	it	went	too	far.”

```
My	gut	twists.	“And	Jake	wouldn’t?”
```

Janae	sniffs.	“No.	He	got	really	into	the	whole	thing	once	Simon
died.	Total	power	trip	watching	you	guys	get	hauled	into	the	station,
seeing	the	school	scrambling	and	everybody	freaking	out	about	the
Tumblr.	 He	 liked	 having	 that	 control.”	 She	 stops	 for	 a	 second	 and
glances	at	me.	“I	guess	you’d	know	about	that.”

Yeah,	I	guess	I	would.	But	I	could	do	without	the	reminder	right
now.	“ _You_ 	could’ve	stopped	it,	Janae,”	I	say,	my	voice	rising	as	anger
starts	to	overtake	my	shock.	“You	should’ve	told	somebody	what	was
going	on.”

“I	 _couldn’t,_ ”	Janae	says,	hunching	her	shoulders.	“One	time	when
we	were	meeting	with	Simon,	Jake	recorded	us	on	his	phone.	I	was
trying	to	talk	sense	into	Simon,	but	the	way	Jake	edited	things	made	it
sound	like	it	was	practically	my	idea.	He	said	he’d	give	the	recording	to
the	police	and	pin	everything	on	me	if	I	didn’t	help.”

She	takes	a	deep,	shuddering	breath.	“I	was	supposed	to	plant	all
the	evidence	on	you.	You	remember	that	day	I	came	to	your	house?	I
had	the	computer	with	me	then.	But	I	couldn’t	do	it.	After	that,	Jake
kept	harassing	me	and	I	panicked.	I	just	dumped	everything	on	Nate.”
She	chokes	out	a	sob.	“It	was	easy.	Nate	doesn’t	lock	anything.	And	I
called	in	the	tip	about	him	instead	of	you.”

“Why?”	My	voice	is	tiny,	and	my	hands	are	shaking	so	badly	that
Simon’s	manifesto	makes	a	rattling	sound.	“Why	didn’t	you	stick	to	the
plan?”

Janae	starts	rocking	back	and	forth	again.	“You	were	nice	to	me.
Hundreds	of	people	in	that	stupid	school	and	 _nobody,_ 	except	you,	ever
asked	if	I	missed	Simon.	I	did.	I	 _do._ 	I	totally	get	how	fucked	up	he	was,
but—he	was	my	only	friend.”	She	starts	crying	hard	again,	her	thin
shoulders	shaking.	“Until	you.	I	know	we’re	not	really	friends	and	you
probably	hate	me	now,	but...I	couldn’t	do	that	to	you.”

I	don’t	know	how	to	respond.	And	if	I	keep	thinking	about	Jake,
I’m	going	to	lose	it.	My	mind	latches	on	to	one	small	piece	of	this
messed-up	 puzzle	 that	 doesn’t	 make	 sense.	 “What	 about	 Cooper’s
entry?	Why	would	Simon	write	the	truth	and	then	replace	it	with	a
lie?”

“That	was	Jake,”	Janae	says,	swiping	at	her	eyes.	“He	made	Simon
change	it.	He	said	he	was	doing	Cooper	a	favor,	but...I	don’t	know.	I
think	it	was	more	he	didn’t	want	anyone	to	know	his	best	friend	was


gay.	 And	 he	 seemed	 pretty	 jealous	 of	 all	 the	 attention	 Cooper	 was
getting	for	baseball.”

My	head’s	spinning.	I	should	be	asking	more	questions,	but	I	can
think	of	only	one.	“Now	what?	Are	you...I	mean,	you	can’t	let	Nate	get
convicted,	Janae.	You’re	going	to	tell	someone,	right?	You	have	to	tell
someone.”

Janae	passes	a	hand	over	her	face.	“I	know.	I’ve	been	sick	about	it
all	week.	But	the	thing	is,	I	don’t	have	anything	except	this	printout.
Jake	has	the	video	version	on	Simon’s	hard	drive,	along	with	all	the
backup	files	that	show	he’d	planned	the	whole	thing	for	months.”

I	brandish	Simon’s	manifesto	like	a	shield.	“This	is	good	enough.
This,	and	your	word,	is	 _plenty._ ”

“What	 would	 even	 happen	 to	 me?”	 Janae	 mutters	 under	 her
breath.	“I’m,	like,	aiding	and	abetting,	right?	Or	obstructing	justice?	 _I_
could	wind	up	in	jail.	And	Jake	has	that	recording	hanging	over	my
head.	He’s	already	pissed	at	me.	I’ve	been	too	afraid	of	him	to	go	to
school.	He	keeps	stopping	by	and—”	The	doorbell	chimes,	and	she
freezes	 as	 my	 phone	 rings	 out	 with	 a	 text.	 “Oh	 God,	 Addy,	 that’s
probably	him.	He	only	ever	comes	by	when	my	parents’	car	isn’t	in	the
driveway.”

My	phone	blares	with	a	message	from	Cooper.	 _Jake’s	here.	What’s
going	on?_ 	I	grab	hold	of	Janae’s	arm.	“Listen.	Let’s	do	to	him	exactly
what	he	did	to	you.	Talk	to	him	about	all	this,	and	we’ll	record	it.	Do
you	have	your	phone	on	you?”

Janae	pulls	it	out	of	her	pocket	as	the	doorbell	rings	again.	“It
won’t	do	any	good.	He	always	makes	me	give	it	to	him	before	we	talk.”

“Okay.	 We’ll	 use	 mine.”	 I	 look	 into	 the	 darkened	 dining	 room
across	from	us.	“I’ll	hide	in	there	while	you	talk	to	him.”

“I	don’t	think	I	can,”	Janae	whispers,	and	I	give	her	arm	a	hard
shake.

“You	have	to.	You	need	to	make	this	right,	Janae.	It’s	gone	way	too
far.”	My	hands	are	trembling,	but	I	manage	to	send	a	quick	text	to
Cooper— _It’s	fine,	just	wait_ —and	get	to	my	feet,	pulling	Janae	with	me
and	shoving	her	toward	the	door.	“Answer	it.”	I	stumble	into	the	dining
room	and	sink	to	my	knees,	opening	my	phone’s	Voice	Recorder	app
and	pressing	Play.	I	put	it	as	close	as	I	dare	to	the	entryway	between


the	dining	room	and	the	living	room,	and	scoot	against	the	wall	next	to
a	china	cabinet.

At	first,	the	blood	rushing	in	my	ears	blocks	out	every	other	sound,
but	when	it	starts	to	recede	I	hear	Jake’s	voice:	“...haven’t	you	been	at
school?”

“I	don’t	feel	well,”	Janae	says.
“Really.”	Jake’s	voice	drips	with	contempt.	“Me	either,	but	I	still
show	up.	Which	you	need	to	do	too.	Business	as	usual,	you	know?”

I	have	to	strain	to	hear	Janae.	“Don’t	you	think	this	has	gone	on
long	enough,	Jake?	I	mean,	Nate’s	in	 _jail._ 	I	realize	that’s	the	plan	and
all,	but	now	that	it’s	happening	it’s	pretty	messed	up.”	I’m	not	sure	the
phone’s	going	to	be	able	to	pick	her	up,	but	there’s	not	much	I	can	do
about	it.	I	can’t	exactly	stage-direct	her	from	the	dining	room.

“I	knew	you	were	freaking	out.”	Jake’s	voice	carries	easily.	“No,	we
fucking	 _can’t,_ 	Janae.	That’d	put	us	both	at	risk.	Anyway,	sending	Nate
to	jail	was	 _your_ 	choice,	wasn’t	it?	That	should’ve	been	Addy,	which	is
why	I’m	here,	by	the	way.	You	fucked	that	up	and	need	to	turn	it
around.	I	have	some	ideas.”

Janae’s	voice	gets	a	little	stronger.	“Simon	was	 _sick,_ 	Jake.	Killing
yourself	and	framing	other	people	for	murder	is	crazy.	I	want	out.	I
won’t	tell	anybody	you’re	involved,	but	I	want	us	to—I	don’t	know—put
out	an	anonymous	note	that	says	it	was	a	hoax	or	something.	We	have
to	make	it	stop.”

Jake	snorts.	“Not	your	call,	Janae.	Don’t	forget	what	I	have	on
hand.	I	can	put	everything	on	your	doorstep	and	walk	away.	There’s
nothing	to	tie	me	to	any	of	this.”

_Wrong,	 asshole,_ I	 think.	 Then	 time	 seems	 to	 stop	 as	 a	 text
message	from	Cooper	crosses	my	phone	with	a	loud	blare	of	Rihanna’s
“Only	Girl.”	 _You	ok?_

I	forgot	the	all-important	step	of	silencing	my	phone	before	using
it	as	a	spy	device.

“What	the	hell?	 _Addy?_ ”	Jake	roars.	I	don’t	even	think,	just	take	off
out	of	the	dining	room	and	through	Janae’s	kitchen,	thanking	God	that
she	has	a	back	door	I	can	burst	through.	Heavy	footsteps	pound	behind
me,	so	instead	of	going	for	Cooper’s	car	I	run	straight	into	the	dense
woods	behind	Janae’s	house.	I	fly	through	the	underbrush	in	a	panic,


dodging	 bushes	 and	 overgrown	 roots	 until	 my	 foot	 hooks	 under
something	and	I	tumble	to	the	ground.	It’s	like	the	gym	track	all	over
again—knees	 torn,	 breath	 gone,	 palms	 raw—except	 this	 time	 my
ankle’s	twisted	also.

I	hear	branches	crashing	behind	me,	farther	away	than	I	would
have	thought	but	heading	straight	to	me.	I	get	to	my	feet,	wincing,	and
weigh	my	options.	One	thing’s	sure	after	everything	I	heard	in	the
living	room—Jake’s	not	leaving	these	woods	till	he	finds	me.	I	don’t
know	if	I	can	hide,	and	I	sure	as	hell	can’t	run.	I	take	a	deep	breath,
scream	 _“Help!”_ 	at	the	top	of	my	lungs,	and	take	off	again,	trying	to
zigzag	away	from	where	I	think	Jake	is	while	still	getting	closer	to
Janae’s	house.

But,	oh	God,	my	ankle	hurts	so	badly.	I’m	barely	dragging	myself
forward,	and	the	noises	behind	me	get	louder	until	a	hand	catches	my
arm	and	yanks	me	back.	I	manage	to	scream	once	more	before	Jake
clamps	his	other	hand	over	my	mouth.

“You	little	bitch,”	he	says	hoarsely.	“You	brought	this	on	yourself,
you	know	that?”	I	sink	my	teeth	into	Jake’s	palm	and	he	lets	out	an
animal	sound	of	pain,	dropping	his	hand	and	lifting	it	just	as	quickly	to
strike	me	across	the	face.

I	stagger,	my	face	aching,	but	manage	to	stay	upright	and	twist	in
an	attempt	to	connect	my	knee	to	his	groin	and	my	nails	to	his	eye.
Jake	grunts	again	when	I	make	contact,	stumbling	enough	that	I	break
free	and	spin	away.	My	ankle	buckles	and	his	hand	locks	around	my
arm,	tight	as	a	vise.	He	pulls	me	toward	him	and	grips	me	hard	by	the
shoulders.	For	one	bizarre	second	I	think	he’s	going	to	kiss	me.

Instead	he	shoves	me	to	the	ground,	kneels	down,	and	slams	my
head	on	a	rock.	My	skull	explodes	with	pain	and	my	vision	goes	red
around	the	edges,	then	black.	Something	presses	across	my	neck	and
I’m	choking.	I	can’t	see	anything,	but	I	can	hear.	“You	should	be	in	jail
instead	of	Nate,	Addy,”	Jake	snarls	as	I	claw	at	his	hands.	“But	this
works	too.”

A	girl’s	panicked	voice	pierces	the	pain	in	my	head.	“Jake,	stop!
Leave	her	alone!”

The	awful	pressure	releases	and	I	gasp	for	air.	I	hear	Jake’s	voice,
low	and	angry,	then	a	shriek	and	a	thud.	I	should	get	up,	 _right	now._ 	I
reach	my	hands	out,	feeling	grass	and	dirt	beneath	my	fingers	as	I


scramble	to	find	an	anchor.	I	just	need	to	pull	myself	off	the	ground.
And	get	these	starbursts	out	of	my	eyes.	One	thing	at	a	time.

Hands	are	at	my	throat	again,	squeezing.	I	lash	out	with	my	legs,
willing	them	to	work	the	way	they	do	on	my	bike,	but	they	feel	like
spaghetti.	I	blink,	blink,	blink	some	more,	until	I	can	finally	see.	Except
now	I	wish	I	couldn’t.	Jake’s	eyes	flash	silver	in	the	moonlight,	filled
with	a	cold	fury.	 _How	did	I	not	see	this	coming?_

I	can’t	budge	his	hands	no	matter	how	hard	I	try.
Then	I	can	breathe	again	as	Jake	flies	backward,	and	I	wonder
dimly	how	and	why	he	did	that.	Sounds	fill	the	air	as	I	roll	onto	my
side,	gasping	to	fill	my	empty	lungs.	Seconds	or	minutes	pass,	it’s	hard
to	tell,	until	a	hand	presses	my	shoulder	and	I	blink	into	a	different
pair	of	eyes.	Kind,	concerned.	And	scared	as	shitless	as	I	am.

“Cooper,”	I	rasp.	He	pulls	me	into	a	sitting	position	and	I	let	my
head	fall	against	his	chest,	feeling	his	heart	hammering	against	my
cheek	as	the	distant	wail	of	sirens	draws	closer.


**Nate**

**Friday,	November	9,	3:40	p.m.**

I	know	something’s	different	by	how	the	guard	looks	at	me	when	he
calls	my	name.	Not	as	much	like	a	piece	of	dirt	he	wants	to	grind	under
his	shoe	as	usual.	“Bring	your	things,”	he	says.	I	don’t	have	much,	but	I
take	my	time	shoving	everything	into	a	plastic	bag	before	I	follow	him
down	the	long	gray	corridor	to	the	warden’s	office.

Eli	hovers	in	the	doorway	with	his	hands	in	his	pockets,	giving	me
that	intense	stare	of	his	times	a	hundred.	“Welcome	to	the	rest	of	your
life,	Nate.”	When	I	don’t	react,	he	adds,	“You’re	free.	You’re	out.	This
whole	thing	was	a	hoax	that’s	been	blown	wide	open.	So	get	out	of	that
jumpsuit	and	into	civilian	clothes,	and	let’s	get	you	the	hell	out	of
here.”

At	this	point	I’m	used	to	doing	what	I’m	told,	so	that’s	all	I	do.
Nothing	else	registers,	even	when	Eli	shows	me	news	stories	about
Jake’s	arrest,	until	he	tells	me	Addy’s	in	the	hospital	with	a	concussion
and	a	fractured	skull.	“Good	news	is,	it’s	a	hairline	fracture	with	no
underlying	brain	injury.	She’ll	make	a	full	recovery.”

Addy,	 that	 airhead	 homecoming	 princess	 turned	 badass	 ninja
investigator,	in	the	hospital	with	a	cracked	skull	because	she	tried	to
help	me.	Possibly	only	alive	because	of	Janae,	who	got	a	busted	jaw	for
her	trouble,	and	Cooper,	who’s	suddenly	some	kind	of	superhero	the
media’s	fawning	over.	I’d	be	happy	for	him	if	the	whole	thing	didn’t
make	me	sick.

There’s	a	lot	of	paperwork	when	you	get	out	of	jail	for	a	crime	you
didn’t	commit.	 _Law	&	Order_ 	never	shows	how	many	forms	you	have	to
fill	out	before	you	rejoin	the	world.	The	first	thing	I	see	when	I	step
blinking	into	bright	sunshine	is	a	dozen	cameras	whirring	to	life.	Of
course.	This	whole	thing’s	a	never-ending	movie,	and	I’ve	gone	from
villain	to	hero	in	a	matter	of	hours	even	though	I	haven’t	done	a	single


thing	to	make	a	difference	since	I	got	here.

My	mother’s	outside,	which	I	guess	is	a	pleasant	surprise.	I’m
never	 _not_ 	prepared	for	her	to	disappear.	And	Bronwyn,	even	though	I
specifically	 said	 I	 didn’t	 want	 her	 anywhere	 near	 this	 place.	 Guess
nobody	thought	I	was	serious	about	that.	Before	I	can	react	her	arms
are	around	me	and	my	face	is	buried	in	her	green-apple	hair.

Jesus.	 This	 girl.	 For	 a	 few	 seconds	 I	 breathe	 her	 in	 and
everything’s	all	right.

Except	it’s	not.
“Nate,	how	does	it	feel	to	be	free?	Do	you	have	any	comment	about
Jake?	 What’s	 your	 next	 step?”	 Eli	 shoots	 sound	 bites	 at	 all	 the
microphones	in	my	face	as	we	make	our	way	to	his	car.	He’s	the	man	of
the	hour,	but	I	don’t	see	what	he	did	to	earn	it.	The	charges	were
dropped	because	Bronwyn	kept	unraveling	threads	and	tracked	down	a
witness.	Because	Cooper’s	boyfriend	connected	dots	nobody	else	saw.
Because	Addy	put	herself	in	the	line	of	fire.	And	because	Cooper	saved
the	day	before	Jake	could	shut	her	up.

I’m	 the	 only	 one	 in	 the	 murder	 club	 who	 didn’t	 contribute	 a
goddamn	thing.	All	I	did	was	be	the	guy	who’s	easy	to	frame.

Eli	 inches	 his	 car	 past	 all	 the	 media	 vans	 until	 we’re	 on	 the
highway	 and	 the	 juvenile	 detention	 center	 fades	 to	 a	 speck	 in	 the
distance.	He’s	rattling	on	about	too	many	things	to	follow:	how	he’s
working	with	Officer	Lopez	to	get	my	drug	charges	dropped;	how	if	I
want	to	make	a	statement	through	the	media	he’d	recommend	Mikhail
Powers;	how	I	need	a	strategy	for	reintegrating	into	school.	I	stare	out
the	window,	my	hand	a	dead	weight	in	Bronwyn’s.	When	I	finally	hear
Eli’s	voice	asking	if	I	have	any	questions,	I	can	tell	he’s	been	repeating
himself	for	a	while.

“Did	someone	feed	Stan?”	I	ask.	My	father	sure	as	shit	didn’t.
“I	did,”	Bronwyn	says.	When	I	don’t	respond,	she	squeezes	my
hand	and	adds,	“Nate,	are	you	all	right?”

She	tries	to	catch	my	eye,	but	I	can’t	do	it.	She	wants	me	to	be
happy	and	I	can’t	do	that	either.	The	impossibility	of	Bronwyn	hits	me
like	a	punch	to	the	gut:	everything	she	wants	is	good	and	right	and
logical	and	I	can’t	do	any	of	it.	She’ll	always	be	that	girl	in	front	of	me
in	 the	 scavenger	 hunt,	 her	 shining	 hair	 hypnotizing	 me	 so	 much	 I


almost	forget	how	uselessly	I’m	trailing	behind	her.

“I	 just	 want	 to	 go	 home	 and	 sleep.”	 I’m	 still	 not	 looking	 at
Bronwyn,	but	out	of	the	corner	of	my	eye	I	can	see	her	face	fall,	and	for
some	reason	that’s	perversely	satisfying.	I’m	disappointing	her	right	on
schedule.	Finally,	something	makes	sense.

**Cooper**

**Saturday,	November	17,	9:30	a.m.**

It’s	pretty	surreal	to	come	downstairs	for	breakfast	Saturday	morning
to	my	grandmother	reading	an	issue	of	 _People_ 	with	me	on	the	cover.

I	didn’t	pose	for	it.	It’s	a	shot	of	Kris	and	me	leaving	the	police
station	after	giving	our	statements.	Kris	looks	fantastic,	and	I	look	like
I	just	woke	up	after	a	night	of	heavy	drinking.	It’s	obvious	which	of	us
is	the	model.

Funny	 how	 this	 accidental-fame	 thing	 works.	 First	 people
supported	me	even	though	I’d	been	accused	of	cheating	and	murder.
Then	they	hated	me	because	of	who	I	turned	out	to	be.	Now	they	love
me	 again	 because	 I	 was	 in	 the	 right	 place	 at	 the	 right	 time	 and
managed	to	flatten	Jake	with	a	well-aimed	punch.

And	because	of	the	halo	effect	of	being	with	Kris,	I	guess.	Eli’s
giving	him	full	credit	for	figuring	out	what	really	happened,	so	he’s	the
new	breakout	star	of	this	whole	mess.	The	fact	that	he’s	trying	to	avoid
the	media	machine	only	makes	them	want	him	more.

Lucas	 sits	 across	 from	 Nonny,	 spooning	 Cocoa	 Puffs	 into	 his
mouth	while	scrolling	through	his	iPad.	“Your	Facebook	fan	page	has	a
hundred	thousand	likes	now,”	he	reports,	flicking	a	strand	of	hair	out
of	his	face	like	it’s	an	annoying	bug.	This	is	good	news	for	Lucas,	who
took	it	personally	when	most	of	my	so-called	fans	deserted	the	page
after	the	police	outed	me.

Nonny	sniffs	and	flings	the	magazine	across	the	table.	“Awful.	One
boy’s	dead,	another	ruined	his	life	and	almost	ruined	yours,	and	people
still	treat	this	like	it’s	a	TV	show.	Thank	God	for	short	attention	spans.
Something	else’ll	come	along	soon	and	you	can	get	back	to	normal.”

Whatever	that	is.
It’s	been	about	a	week	since	Jake	was	arrested.	So	far	he’s	being
charged	with	assault,	obstruction	of	justice,	evidence	tampering,	and	a
whole	bunch	of	other	things	I	can’t	keep	track	of.	He’s	got	his	own


lawyer	now,	and	he’s	in	the	same	detention	center	where	Nate	was
being	held.	Which	I	guess	is	poetic	justice,	but	it	doesn’t	feel	good.	I
still	can’t	reconcile	the	guy	I	pulled	off	Addy	with	the	kid	who’d	been
my	 friend	 since	 ninth	 grade.	 His	 lawyer’s	 talking	 about	 undue
influence	from	Simon,	and	maybe	that	explains	it.	Or	maybe	Ashton
was	right	and	Jake’s	been	a	control	freak	all	along.

Janae’s	cooperating	with	the	police	and	it	looks	like	she’ll	get	a
plea	bargain	in	exchange	for	her	testimony.	She	and	Addy	are	thick	as
thieves	now.	I	have	mixed	feelings	about	Janae	and	the	way	she	let
things	get	this	far.	But	I’m	not	as	innocent	as	I’d	thought,	either.	While
Addy	 was	 zonked	 out	 on	 painkillers	 in	 the	 hospital	 she	 told	 me
everything,	including	how	my	stupid,	panicked	slight	at	junior	prom
made	Simon	hate	me	enough	to	frame	me	for	murder.

I	have	to	figure	out	a	way	to	live	with	that,	and	it	won’t	be	by	not
forgiving	other	people’s	mistakes.

“You	meetin’	Kris	later?”	Nonny	asks.
“Yup,”	I	say.	Lucas	keeps	eating	cereal	without	blinking	an	eye.
Turns	out	he	couldn’t	care	less	that	his	older	brother	has	a	boyfriend.
Although	he	does	seem	to	miss	Keely.

Who	I’m	also	seeing	today,	before	Kris	and	I	get	together.	Partly
because	I	owe	her	an	apology,	and	partly	because	she’s	been	sucked
into	this	mess	too,	even	though	the	police	tried	to	keep	her	name	out	of
Simon’s	confession.	It	wasn’t	part	of	the	public	record,	but	people	at
school	knew	enough	to	guess.	I	texted	her	earlier	in	the	week	to	see
how	she	was	doing,	and	she	texted	back	an	apology	for	not	being	more
supportive	when	the	story	about	me	and	Kris	broke.	Which	was	pretty
big	of	her,	considering	all	the	lies	I	told.

We	went	back	and	forth	for	a	while	after	that.	She	was	pretty
broken	up	about	the	part	she	played	in	everything,	even	though	she
had	no	idea	what	was	happening.	I’m	one	of	the	few	people	in	town
who	can	understand	how	that	feels.

Maybe	we	can	manage	to	be	friends	after	all	this.	I’d	like	that.
Pop	comes	into	the	kitchen	with	his	laptop,	jiggling	it	like	there’s	a
present	inside.	“You	check	your	email?”

```
“Not	this	morning.”
“Josh	 Langley’s	 touching	 base.	 Wants	 to	 know	 what	 you’re
```

thinking	 about	 college	 versus	 the	 draft.	 And	 the	 UCLA	 offer	 came
through.	Still	nothin’	from	LSU,	though.”	Pop	won’t	be	happy	until	all
the	 top-five	 college	 baseball	 teams	 make	 me	 a	 scholarship	 offer.
Louisiana	State	is	the	lone	holdout,	which	annoys	him	since	they’re
ranked	number	one.	“Anyway,	Josh	wants	to	talk	next	week.	You	up	for
it?”

“Sure,”	I	say,	even	though	I’ve	already	decided	I’m	not	going	right
into	the	draft.	The	more	I	think	about	my	baseball	future,	the	more	I
want	college	ball	to	be	the	next	step.	I	have	the	rest	of	my	life	to	play
baseball,	but	only	a	few	years	to	go	to	college.

And	my	first	choice	is	Cal	State.	Since	they’re	the	only	school	that
didn’t	back	away	from	me	when	I	was	down.

But	it’ll	make	Pop	happy	to	talk	with	Josh	Langley.	We’ve	gotten
back	 on	 tentative	 father-son	 footing	 since	 the	 good	 baseball	 news
started	pouring	in.	He	still	doesn’t	talk	to	me	about	Kris,	and	clams	up
when	 anyone	 else	 mentions	 him.	 He	 doesn’t	 bolt	 out	 of	 the	 room
anymore,	though.	And	he’s	looking	me	in	the	eye	again.

```
It’s	a	start.
```
**Addy**

**Saturday,	November	17,	2:15	p.m.**

I	can’t	ride	my	bike	because	of	the	skull	fracture	and	my	sprained
ankle,	 so	 Ashton	 drives	 me	 to	 my	 follow-up	 doctor’s	 appointment.
Everything’s	 healing	 the	 way	 it	 should,	 although	 I	 still	 get	 instant
headaches	if	I	move	my	head	too	fast.

The	emotional	stuff	will	take	longer.	Half	the	time	I	feel	like	Jake
died,	and	the	other	half	I	want	to	kill	him.	I	can	admit,	now,	that
Ashton	and	TJ	weren’t	wrong	about	how	things	were	between	Jake	and
me.	He	ran	everything,	and	I	let	him.	But	I	never	would	have	believed
he	could	be	capable	of	what	he	did	in	the	woods.	My	heart	feels	like	my
skull	did	right	after	Jake	attacked	me—as	though	it’s	been	split	in	two
with	a	dull	ax.

I	don’t	know	how	to	feel	about	Simon,	either.	Sometimes	I	get
really	sad	when	I	think	about	how	he	planned	to	ruin	four	people
because	he	thought	we’d	taken	away	from	him	things	that	everybody
wants:	to	be	successful,	to	have	friends,	to	be	loved.	To	be	 _seen._

```
But	most	of	the	time	I	just	wish	I’d	never	met	him.
```

Nate	visited	me	in	the	hospital	and	I’ve	seen	him	a	few	times	since
I’ve	been	out.	I’m	worried	about	him.	He’s	not	one	to	open	up,	but	he
said	enough	that	I	could	tell	getting	arrested	made	him	feel	pretty
useless.	I’ve	been	trying	to	convince	him	otherwise,	but	I	don’t	think
it’s	sinking	in.	I	wish	he’d	listen,	because	if	anyone	knows	how	badly
you	can	screw	up	your	life	when	you	decide	you’re	not	good	enough,
it’s	me.

TJ’s	texted	a	few	times	since	I	was	discharged	a	couple	of	days
ago.	He	kept	dropping	hints	about	asking	me	out,	so	I	finally	had	to	tell
him	it’s	not	happening.	There’s	no	way	I	can	hook	up	with	the	person
who	helped	me	set	off	this	whole	chain	reaction.	It’s	too	bad,	because
there	might’ve	been	potential	if	we’d	gone	about	things	differently.	But
I’m	starting	to	realize	there	are	some	things	you	can’t	undo,	no	matter
how	good	your	intentions	are.

It’s	all	right,	though.	I	don’t	agree	with	my	mother	that	TJ	was	my
last,	best	hope	to	avoid	premature	spinsterhood.	She’s	not	the	expert
she	thinks	she	is	on	relationships.

I’d	rather	take	my	cues	from	Ashton,	who’s	getting	a	kick	out	of
Eli’s	sudden	infatuation.	He	tracked	her	down	after	things	settled	with
Nate	and	asked	her	out.	She	told	him	she’s	not	ready	to	date	yet,	so	he
keeps	 interrupting	 his	 insane	 workload	 to	 take	 her	 on	 elaborate,
carefully	planned	not-dates.	Which,	she	has	to	admit,	she’s	enjoying.

“I’m	not	sure	I	can	take	him	seriously,	though,”	she	tells	me	as	I
hobble	 to	 the	 car	 on	 crutches	 after	 my	 checkup.	 “I	 mean,	 the	 hair
alone.”

“I	like	the	hair.	It	has	character.	Plus,	it	looks	soft,	like	a	cloud.”
Ashton	grins	and	brushes	a	stray	lock	of	mine	off	my	forehead.	“I
like	 _yours._ 	Grow	it	a	little	more	and	we’ll	be	twins.”

That’s	my	secret	plan.	I’ve	been	coveting	Ashton’s	hair	all	along.
“I	have	something	to	show	you,”	she	says	as	she	pulls	away	from
the	hospital.	“Some	good	news.”

“Really?	 What?”	 Sometimes	 it’s	 hard	 to	 remember	 what	 good
news	feels	like.

```
Ashton	shakes	her	head	and	smiles.	“It’s	a	show,	not	a	tell.”
She	pulls	up	in	front	of	a	new	apartment	building	in	the	closest
```

thing	Bayview	has	to	a	trendy	neighborhood.	Ashton	matches	my	slow
pace	as	we	step	into	a	bright	atrium,	and	guides	me	to	a	bench	in	the
lobby.	“Wait	here,”	she	says,	propping	my	crutches	next	to	the	bench.
She	disappears	around	the	corner,	and	when	she	returns	ten	minutes
later	she	leads	me	to	an	elevator	and	we	head	for	the	third	floor.

Ashton	fits	a	key	into	a	door	marked	302	and	pushes	it	open	to	a
large	 apartment	 with	 soaring,	 loftlike	 ceilings.	 It’s	 all	 windows	 and
exposed	brick	and	polished	wood	floors,	and	I	love	it	instantly.	“What
do	you	think?”	she	asks.

I	lean	my	crutches	against	the	wall	and	hop	into	the	open	kitchen,
admiring	 the	 mosaic	 tile	 backsplash.	 Who	 knew	 Bayview	 had
something	like	this?	“It’s	beautiful.	Are	you,	um,	thinking	of	renting
it?”	I	try	to	sound	enthusiastic	and	not	terrified	of	Ashton	leaving	me
alone	with	Mom.	Ashton	hasn’t	been	home	all	that	long,	but	I’ve	gotten
kind	of	attached	to	having	her	there.

“I	already	did,”	she	says	with	a	grin,	spinning	around	a	little	on	the
hardwood	floors.	“Charlie	and	I	got	an	offer	on	the	condo	while	you
were	in	the	hospital.	It	still	has	to	close,	but	once	it	does,	we’ll	make	a
pretty	good	profit.	He’s	agreed	to	take	on	all	his	student	loans	as	part
of	the	divorce	settlement.	My	design	work’s	still	slow,	but	I’ll	have
enough	of	a	cushion	that	it	won’t	be	a	stretch.	And	Bayview’s	so	much
more	affordable	than	San	Diego.	This	apartment	downtown	would	cost
three	times	as	much.”

“That’s	fantastic!”	I	hope	I’m	doing	a	good	job	of	acting	excited.	I
_am_ 	excited	for	her,	truly.	I’ll	just	miss	her.	“You’d	better	have	a	spare
room	so	I	can	visit.”

“I	do	have	a	spare	room,”	Ashton	says.	“I	don’t	want	you	to	visit,
though.”

I	stare	at	her.	I	can’t	have	heard	her	correctly.	I	thought	we’d	been
getting	along	great	these	past	couple	of	months.

She	laughs	at	my	expression.	“I	want	you	to	 _live_ 	here,	silly.	You
need	to	get	out	of	that	house	as	much	as	I	do.	Mom	said	it’s	okay.	She’s
in	 that	 decline	 phase	 with	 Justin	 where	 she	 thinks	 lots	 of	 private
couple	time	will	fix	their	problems.	Plus,	you’ll	be	eighteen	in	a	few
months	and	can	live	wherever	you	want	then	anyway.”

I	grab	her	in	a	hug	before	she	can	finish,	and	she	suffers	it	for	a
few	seconds	before	ducking	away.	We	still	haven’t	mastered	the	art	of


non-awkward	sisterly	affection.	“Go	ahead,	check	out	your	room.	It’s
over	there.”

I	limp	into	a	sun-splashed	room	with	a	huge	window	overlooking	a
bike	path	behind	the	building.	Built-in	bookshelves	line	the	wall,	and
exposed	beams	in	the	ceiling	frame	an	amazing	light	fixture	with	a
dozen	Edison	bulbs	in	different	shapes	and	sizes.	I	love	everything
about	it.	Ashton	leans	against	the	doorway	and	smiles	at	me.

```
“Fresh	start	for	both	of	us,	huh?”
It	finally	feels	like	that	might	be	true.
```
**Bronwyn**

**Sunday,	November	18,	10:45	a.m.**

The	day	after	Nate	was	released,	I	gave	my	one	and	only	interview	to
the	media.	I	didn’t	mean	to.	But	Mikhail	Powers	himself	ambushed	me
outside	my	house,	and	as	I	expected	when	I	first	saw	the	full	force	of
his	charm	turned	on	our	case,	I	couldn’t	resist	him.

“Bronwyn	Rojas.	The	girl	most	likely.”	He	was	dressed	in	a	crisp
navy	suit	and	subtly	patterned	tie,	gold	cuff	links	glinting	as	he	held
out	his	hand	with	a	warm	smile.	I	almost	didn’t	notice	the	camera
behind	him.	“I’ve	been	wanting	to	talk	to	you	for	weeks.	You	never
gave	 up	 on	 your	 friend,	 did	 you?	 I	 admire	 that.	 I’ve	 admired	 you
throughout	this	entire	case.”

“Thanks,”	I	said	weakly.	It	was	a	transparent	attempt	to	butter	me
up	and	it	totally	worked.

“I	 would	 love	 your	 take	 on	 everything.	 Can	 you	 spare	 a	 few
minutes	to	tell	us	what	this	ordeal	has	been	like	for	you,	and	how	you
feel	now	that	it’s	over?”

I	 shouldn’t	 have.	 Robin	 and	 my	 family	 had	 held	 our	 last	 legal
meeting	 that	 morning,	 and	 her	 parting	 advice	 was	 to	 keep	 a	 low
profile.	She	was	right,	as	usual.	But	there	was	something	I’d	wanted	to
get	off	my	chest	that	I	hadn’t	been	allowed	to	say	before.

“Just	one	thing.”	I	looked	into	the	camera	while	Mikhail	smiled
encouragingly.	“I	did	cheat	in	my	chemistry	class,	and	I’m	sorry.	Not
only	because	it	got	me	into	this	mess,	but	because	it	was	an	awful	thing
to	do.	My	parents	raised	me	to	be	honest	and	work	hard,	like	they	do,
and	I	let	them	down.	It	wasn’t	fair	to	them,	or	my	teachers,	or	the
colleges	I	wanted	to	apply	to.	And	it	wasn’t	fair	to	Simon.”	My	voice


started	shaking	then,	and	I	couldn’t	blink	back	the	tears	any	longer.	“If
I’d	known...If	I’d	thought...I	won’t	ever	stop	being	sorry	for	what	I	did.
I’ll	never	do	anything	like	that	again.	That’s	all	I	want	to	say.”

I	doubt	that’s	what	Mikhail	was	hoping	for,	but	he	used	it	anyway
for	his	final	Bayview	report.	Rumor	has	it	he’s	submitting	the	series	for
Emmy	consideration.

My	parents	keep	telling	me	I	can’t	blame	myself	for	what	Simon
did.	Just	like	I	keep	telling	Cooper	and	Addy	the	same	thing.	And	I’d
tell	Nate,	if	he’d	let	me,	but	I’ve	barely	heard	from	him	since	he	got	out
of	juvenile	detention.	He	talks	to	Addy	more	than	me	now.	I	mean,	he
_should_ 	talk	to	Addy,	who	is	obviously	a	rock	star.	But	still.

He	finally	agreed	to	let	me	stop	by	and	catch	up,	but	I	don’t	feel
my	 usual	 excited	 anticipation	 as	 I	 ring	 his	 doorbell.	 Something’s
changed	since	he	was	arrested.	I	almost	don’t	expect	him	to	be	home,
but	he	opens	the	creaking	door	and	steps	aside.

Nate’s	house	looks	better	than	it	did	when	I	was	feeding	Stan.	His
mother’s	staying	here	and	she’s	added	all	sorts	of	new	touches	like
curtains,	throw	pillows,	and	framed	pictures.	The	only	time	Nate	spoke
to	 me	 at	 any	 length	 after	 he	 got	 home,	 he	 said	 his	 mother	 had
convinced	his	father	to	try	a	stint	at	rehab.	Nate	didn’t	hold	out	much
hope	for	it,	but	I’m	sure	having	his	father	out	of	the	house	temporarily
is	a	relief.

Nate	flops	into	an	armchair	in	the	living	room	as	I	make	my	way
over	to	Stan	and	peer	into	his	cage,	glad	for	the	distraction.	He	lifts	one
of	his	front	legs	in	my	direction,	and	I	laugh	in	surprise.	“Did	Stan	just
_wave_ 	at	me?”

“Yeah.	He	does	that,	like,	once	a	year.	It’s	his	only	move.”	Nate
meets	my	eyes	with	a	grin,	and	for	a	second	things	are	normal	between
us.	Then	his	smile	fades	and	he	looks	down.	“So.	I	don’t	actually	have	a
lot	of	time.	Officer	Lopez	wants	to	hook	me	up	with	a	weekend	job	at
some	construction	company	in	Eastland.	I	have	to	be	there	in	twenty
minutes.”

“That’s	great.”	I	swallow	hard.	Why	is	it	so	hard	to	talk	to	him
now?	It	was	the	easiest	thing	in	the	world	a	few	weeks	ago.	“I	just—I
guess	I	wanted	to	say,	um,	I	know	you	went	through	something	awful
and	I	understand	if	you	don’t	want	to	talk	about	it,	but	I’m	here	if	you
do.	And	I	still...care	about	you.	As	much	as	ever.	So.	That’s	all,	I	guess.”


It’s	an	awkward	start,	made	worse	by	the	fact	that	he	won’t	look	at
me	during	my	sad	little	speech.	When	he	finally	does,	his	eyes	are	flat.

“I’ve	been	meaning	to	talk	to	you	about	that.	First,	thanks	for
everything	you	did.	Seriously,	I	owe	you	one.	I	probably	won’t	ever	be
able	to	repay	you.	But	it’s	time	to	get	back	to	normal,	right?	And	we’re
not	each	other’s	normal.”	He	averts	his	eyes	again,	and	it’s	killing	me.
If	he’d	look	at	me	for	more	than	ten	seconds	I’m	positive	he	wouldn’t
say	this.

“No,	we’re	not.”	I’m	surprised	at	how	steady	my	voice	is.	“But
that’s	never	mattered	to	me,	and	I	didn’t	think	it	mattered	to	you.	My
feelings	haven’t	changed,	Nate.	I	still	want	to	be	with	you.”

I’ve	 never	 said	 anything	 that	 matters	 so	 much	 in	 such	 a
straightforward	way,	and	at	first	I’m	glad	I	didn’t	wimp	out.	But	Nate
looks	like	he	couldn’t	care	less.	And	while	I’m	not	fazed	by	external
obstacles	thrown	my	way— _Disapproving	parents?	No	problem!	Jail
time?	I’ll	get	you	out!_ —his	indifference	makes	me	wilt.

“I	don’t	see	the	point.	We’ve	got	separate	lives,	and	nothing	in
common	now	that	the	investigation’s	wrapped	up.	You	need	to	get
ready	for	the	Ivy	League,	and	I—”	He	lets	out	a	humorless	snort.	“I’ll	be
doing	whatever	the	opposite	of	that	is.”

I	want	to	throw	my	arms	around	him	and	kiss	him	until	he	stops
talking	like	this.	But	his	face	is	closed	off,	as	though	his	mind’s	already
a	thousand	miles	away,	waiting	for	his	body	to	catch	up.	Like	he	only
let	me	come	here	out	of	a	sense	of	obligation.	And	I	can’t	stand	it.

“If	that’s	how	you	feel.”
He	nods	so	fast	that	whatever	tiny	flicker	of	hope	I	might’ve	been
nursing	 disappears.	 “Yup.	 Good	 luck	 with	 everything,	 Bronwyn.
Thanks	again.”

He	stands	up	like	he’s	going	to	walk	me	to	the	door,	but	I	can’t
take	fake	politeness	right	now.	“Don’t	bother,”	I	say,	stalking	past	him
with	my	eyes	on	the	floor.	I	let	myself	out	and	walk	stiffly	to	my	car,
willing	myself	not	to	run,	and	fumble	through	my	bag	with	shaking
hands	until	I	find	my	keys.

I	drive	home	with	dry,	unblinking	eyes	and	make	it	all	the	way	to
my	 room	 before	 I	 lose	 it.	 Maeve	 knocks	 softly	 and	 enters	 without
waiting	for	an	invitation,	curling	up	next	to	me	and	stroking	my	hair


while	I	sob	into	a	pillow	like	my	heart	just	broke.	Which	I	guess	it	did.

“I’m	sorry,”	she	says.	She	knew	where	I	was	headed,	and	I	don’t
need	to	tell	her	how	it	went.	“He’s	being	a	jerk.”

She	doesn’t	say	anything	else	until	I	wear	myself	out	and	sit	up,
rubbing	my	eyes.	I’d	forgotten	how	tired	full-body	crying	can	make
you.	“Sorry	I	can’t	make	this	better,”	Maeve	says,	reaching	into	her
pocket	and	pulling	out	her	phone.	“But	I	have	something	to	show	you
that	might	cheer	you	up.	Lots	of	reaction	on	Twitter	to	your	statement
on	 _Mikhail	Powers	Investigates._ 	All	positive,	by	the	way.”

“Maeve,	I	don’t	care	about	 _Twitter,_ ”	I	say	wearily.	I	haven’t	been
on	there	since	this	whole	mess	started.	Even	with	my	profile	set	to
private,	I	couldn’t	deal	with	the	onslaught	of	opinions.

“I	know.	But	you	should	see	this.”	She	hands	me	her	phone	and
points	to	a	post	on	my	timeline	from	Yale	University:

_To	err	is	human	@BronwynRojas.	We	look	forward	to	receiving
your	application._


#### THREE	MONTHS	LATER

**Bronwyn**

**Friday,	February	16,	6:50	p.m.**

I’m	sort	of	seeing	Evan	Neiman	now.	It	snuck	up	on	me.	First	we	were
together	a	lot	in	big	groups,	then	smaller	ones,	and	a	few	weeks	ago	he
drove	 me	 home	 after	 a	 bunch	 of	 us	 hate-watched	 _The	Bachelor_ at
Yumiko’s	house.	When	we	got	to	my	driveway,	he	leaned	over	and
kissed	me.

It	was...nice.	He’s	a	good	kisser.	I	found	myself	analyzing	the	kiss
in	 almost	 clinical	 detail	 while	 it	 was	 happening,	 mentally
congratulating	him	on	a	stellar	technique	while	noting	the	absence	of
any	heat	or	magnetic	pull	between	us.	My	heart	didn’t	pound	as	I
kissed	him	back,	and	my	limbs	didn’t	shake.	It	was	a	good	kiss	with	a
nice	boy.	The	kind	I’d	always	wanted.

Now	things	are	almost	exactly	how	I	thought	they’d	be	when	I	first
imagined	dating	Evan.	We	make	a	solid	couple.	I	have	an	automatic
date	for	the	spring	break	dance,	which	is	nice.	But	I’m	planning	my
post-Bayview	life	on	a	parallel	track	that	has	nothing	to	do	with	him.
We’re	an	until-graduation	couple,	at	best.

I	applied	to	Yale,	but	not	early	decision.	I’ll	find	out	next	month
along	with	everyone	else	whether	I	got	in	or	not.	It	doesn’t	seem	like
the	be-all,	end-all	of	my	future	anymore,	though.	I’ve	been	interning
for	Eli	on	the	weekends,	and	I’m	starting	to	see	the	appeal	of	staying
local	and	keeping	up	with	Until	Proven.

Everything’s	pretty	fluid,	and	I’m	trying	to	be	okay	with	that.	I
think	 a	 lot	 about	 Simon	 and	 about	 what	 the	 media	 called	 his
“aggrieved	entitlement”—the	belief	he	was	owed	something	he	didn’t
get,	and	everyone	should	pay	because	of	it.	It’s	almost	impossible	to


understand,	except	by	that	corner	of	my	brain	that	pushed	me	to	cheat
for	 validation	 I	 hadn’t	 earned.	 I	 don’t	 ever	 want	 to	 be	 that	 person
again.

The	only	time	I	see	Nate	is	at	school.	He’s	there	more	often	than
he	used	to	be,	and	I	guess	he’s	doing	all	right.	I	don’t	know	for	sure,
though,	because	we	don’t	talk	anymore.	At	all.	He	wasn’t	kidding	about
going	back	to	separate	lives.

Sometimes	I	almost	catch	him	looking	at	me,	but	it’s	probably
wishful	thinking.

He’s	still	on	my	mind	constantly,	and	it	sucks.	I’d	hoped	starting
up	with	Evan	might	curb	the	Nate	loop	in	my	head,	but	it’s	made
things	worse.	So	I	try	not	to	think	about	Evan	unless	I’m	actually	with
him,	 which	 means	 I	 sometimes	 overlook	 things	 that	 I	 shouldn’t	 as
Evan’s	sort-of	girlfriend.	Like	tonight.

I	have	a	piano	solo	with	the	San	Diego	Symphony.	It’s	part	of	their
High	School	Spotlight	concert	series,	something	I’ve	applied	for	since	I
was	a	freshman	without	ever	getting	an	invitation.	Last	month,	I	finally
did.	It’s	probably	due	to	residual	notoriety,	although	I	like	to	think	the
audition	video	I	submitted	of	“Variations	on	the	Canon”	helped.	I’ve
improved	a	lot	since	the	fall.

“Are	 you	 nervous?”	 Maeve	 asks	 as	 we	 head	 downstairs.	 She’s
dressed	 for	 the	 concert	 in	 a	 burgundy	 velvet	 dress	 that	 has	 a
Renaissance	feel,	her	hair	in	a	loose	braid	threaded	with	small	jeweled
pins.	She	recently	got	the	part	of	Lady	Guinevere	in	the	drama	club’s
upcoming	 _King	Arthur,_ 	and	she’s	gone	a	little	overboard	getting	in
character.	 It	 suits	 her,	 though.	 I’m	 more	 conservative	 in	 a	 scoop-
necked	jacquard	dress	with	a	subtle	gray-and-black	tonal-dot	pattern
that	nips	in	at	the	waist	and	flares	out	above	my	knees.

“A	 little,”	 I	 reply,	 but	 she’s	 only	 half	 listening.	 Her	 fingers	 fly
across	her	phone,	probably	arranging	yet	another	weekend	rehearsal
with	the	boy	who	plays	Lancelot	in	 _King	Arthur._ 	Who	she	insists	is	just
a	friend.	 _Right._

I	have	my	own	phone	out,	texting	last-minute	directions	to	Kate,
Yumiko,	 and	 Addy.	 Cooper’s	 bringing	 Kris,	 although	 they’re	 having
dinner	with	his	parents	first,	so	they	might	be	late.	With	Kris’s	parents,
that	is.	Cooper’s	dad	is	slowly	coming	around,	but	he’s	not	at	that	stage
yet.	 Yumiko	 texts	 _Should	 we	 look	 for	 Evan?_ and	 at	 that	 point	 I


remember	I	never	invited	him.

It’s	fine,	though.	It’s	not	a	big	deal.	It	was	in	the	newspaper,	and
I’m	sure	he	would	have	mentioned	it	if	he’d	seen	it	and	wanted	to
come.

```

```
We’re	at	Copley	Symphony	Hall,	in	front	of	a	capacity	crowd.	When	it’s
my	turn	to	play	I	walk	onto	a	huge	stage	that	dwarfs	the	piano	at	its
center.	The	crowd’s	silent	except	the	occasional	cough,	and	my	heels
click	 loudly	 on	 the	 polished	 floor.	 I	 smooth	 my	 dress	 beneath	 me
before	taking	a	seat	on	the	ebony	bench.	I’ve	never	performed	in	front
of	this	many	people,	but	I’m	not	as	nervous	as	I	thought	I’d	be.

I	flex	my	fingers	and	wait	for	a	signal	from	backstage.	When	I
start,	I	can	tell	right	away	it’s	going	to	be	the	best	I’ve	ever	played.
Every	note	flows,	but	it’s	not	only	that.	When	I	reach	the	crescendo
and	the	soft	notes	that	follow,	I	pour	every	ounce	of	emotion	from	the
past	few	months	into	the	keys	beneath	my	fingers.	I	feel	each	note	like
a	heartbeat.	And	I	know	the	audience	does	too.

Loud	applause	echoes	through	the	room	when	I	finish.	I	stand	and
incline	 my	 head,	 absorbing	 the	 crowd’s	 approval	 until	 the	 stage
manager	beckons	me	and	I	walk	into	the	wings.	Backstage	I	collect
flowers	my	parents	left	for	me,	holding	them	close	while	I	listen	to	the
rest	of	the	performers.

Afterward	 I	 catch	 up	 with	 my	 friends	 in	 the	 foyer.	 Kate	 and
Yumiko	give	me	a	smaller	bouquet	of	flowers,	which	I	add	to	the	ones
already	in	my	hands.	Addy	is	pink-cheeked	and	smiling,	wearing	her
new	track	team	jacket	over	a	black	dress	like	the	world’s	unlikeliest
jock.	Her	hair’s	in	a	choppy	bob	that’s	almost	exactly	like	her	sister’s
except	the	color.	She	decided	to	go	full-on	purple	instead	of	back	to
blond,	and	it	suits	her.

“That	 was	 so	 good!”	 she	 says	 gleefully,	 pulling	 me	 into	 a	 hug.
“They	should	have	let	you	play	 _all_ 	the	songs.”

To	 my	 surprise,	 Ashton	 and	 Eli	 come	 up	 behind	 her.	 Ashton
mentioned	she’d	be	here,	but	I	didn’t	think	Eli	would	leave	the	office	so
early.	I	guess	I	should	have	known	better.	They’re	an	official	couple
now,	 and	 Eli	 somehow	 manages	 to	 find	 time	 for	 whatever	 Ashton
wants	to	do.	He’s	wearing	that	moony	grin	he	always	has	around	her,
and	I	doubt	he	heard	a	note	I	played.	“Not	bad,	Bronwyn,”	he	says.


“I	got	you	on	video,”	Cooper	says,	brandishing	his	phone.	“I’ll	text
it	once	I	make	a	few	edits.”

Kris,	who	looks	dashing	in	a	sports	jacket	and	dark	jeans,	rolls	his
eyes.	“Cooper	finally	learned	how	to	use	iMovie,	and	now	there’s	no
stopping	him.	Trust	me.	I	have	tried.”	Cooper	grins	unrepentantly	and
puts	his	phone	away,	slipping	his	hand	into	Kris’s.

Addy	keeps	craning	her	neck	to	look	around	the	crowded	foyer,	so
much	that	I	wonder	if	she	brought	a	date.	“Expecting	someone?”	I	ask.

“What?	No,”	she	says	with	a	breezy	wave.	“Just	checking	things
out.	Beautiful	building.”

Addy	has	the	world’s	worst	poker	face.	I	follow	her	eyes	but	can’t
catch	 a	 glimpse	 of	 any	 potential	 mystery	 guy.	 She	 doesn’t	 seem
disappointed,	though.

People	 keep	 stopping	 to	 talk,	 so	 it	 takes	 half	 an	 hour	 before
Maeve,	my	parents,	and	I	work	our	way	outside.	My	father	squints	at
the	twinkling	stars	above	us.	“I	had	to	park	pretty	far	away.	You	three
don’t	want	to	walk	there	in	heels.	Wait	here	and	I’ll	bring	the	car.”

“All	right,”	my	mother	says,	kissing	his	cheek.	I	clutch	my	flowers
and	look	at	all	the	well-dressed	people	surrounding	us,	laughing	and
murmuring	as	they	spill	onto	the	sidewalks.	A	line	of	sleek	cars	pulls
forward,	and	I	watch	them	even	though	it’s	too	soon	for	my	father	to	be
among	them.	A	Lexus.	A	Range	Rover.	A	Jaguar.

A	motorcycle.
My	heart	pounds	as	the	bike’s	lights	dim	and	its	rider	removes	his
helmet.	Nate	climbs	off,	skirting	past	an	older	couple,	and	advances
toward	me	with	his	eyes	locked	on	mine.

I	can’t	breathe.
Maeve	 tugs	 on	 my	 mother’s	 arm.	 “We	 should	 go	 closer	 to	 the
parking	lot	so	Dad	sees	us.”	My	eyes	are	on	Nate,	so	I	hear	rather	than
see	Mom’s	deep	sigh.	But	she	moves	away	with	Maeve,	and	I’m	alone
on	the	sidewalk	when	Nate	reaches	me.

“Hey.”	He	looks	at	me	with	those	dreamy,	dark-fringed	eyes,	and
resentment	surges	through	my	veins.	I	don’t	want	to	see	his	stupid
eyes,	his	stupid	mouth,	and	every	other	part	of	his	stupid	face	that’s
made	me	miserable	for	the	past	three	months.	I	had	one	night,	finally,


where	I	got	to	lose	myself	in	something	besides	my	pathetic	love	life.
Now	he’s	ruined	it.

But	I’m	not	going	to	give	him	the	satisfaction	of	knowing	that.	“Hi,
Nate.”	I’m	surprised	at	my	calm,	neutral	voice.	You’d	never	guess	how
desperately	 my	 heart’s	 trying	 to	 escape	 my	 rib	 cage.	 “How’ve	 you
been?”

“Okay,”	 he	 says,	 shoving	 his	 hands	 into	 his	 pockets.	 He	 looks
almost—awkward?	It’s	a	novel	stance	for	him.	“My	dad’s	back	in	rehab.
But	they	say	that’s	positive.	That	he’s	giving	it	another	shot.”

“That’s	great.	I	hope	it	works	out.”	I	don’t	sound	like	I	mean	it,
even	though	I	do.	The	longer	he	stands	there,	the	harder	it	is	to	act
natural.	“How’s	your	mom?”

“Good.	Working.	She	moved	everything	from	Oregon,	so—I	guess
she’ll	be	here	for	a	while.	That’s	the	plan,	anyway.”	He	runs	a	hand
through	his	hair	and	shoots	me	another	half-lidded	glance.	The	kind	he
used	to	give	right	before	he	kissed	me.	“I	saw	your	solo.	I	was	wrong,
that	night	at	your	house	when	I	first	heard	you.	 _That,_ 	tonight,	was	the
best	thing	I’ve	ever	heard.”

I	squeeze	the	stems	of	my	flowers	so	hard	that	thorns	from	the
roses	prick	me.	“Why?”

“Why	what?”
“Why	did	you	come?	I	mean—”	I	lift	my	chin	toward	the	crowd.
“It’s	not	really	your	thing,	is	it?”

“No,”	Nate	admits.	“But	this	is	a	big	deal	for	you,	right?	I	wanted
to	see	it.”

“Why?”	I	repeat.	I	want	to	ask	more,	but	I	can’t.	My	throat	closes
and	I’m	horrified	as	my	eyes	prickle	and	fill.	I	concentrate	on	breathing
and	press	my	hands	against	the	thorns,	willing	the	mild	pain	to	distract
me.	Okay.	There	we	go.	Tears	receding.	Disaster	averted.

In	the	seconds	I’ve	been	pulling	myself	together,	Nate’s	stepped
closer.	I	don’t	know	where	to	look	because	there’s	no	part	of	him	that
doesn’t	undo	me.

“Bronwyn.”	Nate	rubs	the	back	of	his	neck	and	swallows	hard,	and
I	realize	he’s	as	nervous	as	I	am.	“I’ve	been	an	idiot.	Being	arrested
messed	with	my	head.	I	thought	you’d	be	better	off	without	me	in	your


life	so	I	just...made	that	happen.	I’m	sorry.”

I	drop	my	eyes	to	his	sneakers,	which	seem	like	the	safest	spot.	I
don’t	trust	myself	to	speak.

“The	 thing	 is...I	 never	 really	 had	 anybody,	 you	 know?	 I’m	 not
saying	that	so	you’ll	feel	bad	for	me.	Just	to	try	and	explain.	I	don’t—I
didn’t—get	how	stuff	like	this	works.	That	you	can’t	pretend	you	don’t
give	a	crap	and	it’s	done.”	Nate	shifts	his	weight	from	one	foot	to	the
other,	which	I	notice	since	my	eyes	remain	fastened	on	the	ground.
“I’ve	been	talking	to	Addy	about	this,	because”—he	laughs	a	little—“she
won’t	let	it	go.	I	asked	her	if	she	thought	you’d	be	mad	if	I	tried	to	talk
to	you	and	she	said	it	didn’t	matter.	That	I	owe	you	an	explanation
anyway.	She’s	right.	As	usual.”

Addy.	That	meddler.	No	wonder	she’d	been	bobbleheading	all	over
Symphony	Hall.

I	clear	my	throat	to	try	to	dislodge	the	lump,	but	it’s	no	good.	I’ll
have	to	talk	around	it.	“You	weren’t	just	my	boyfriend,	Nate.	You	were
my	 _friend._ 	Or	I	thought	you	were.	And	then	you	stopped	talking	to	me
like	we	were	nothing.”	I	have	to	bite	hard	on	the	inside	of	my	cheek	to
keep	from	tearing	up	again.

“I	know.	It	was—	God,	I	can’t	even	explain	it,	Bronwyn.	You	were
the	 best	 thing	 that	 ever	 happened	 to	 me,	 and	 it	 freaked	 me	 out.	 I
thought	I’d	ruin	you.	Or	you’d	ruin	me.	That’s	how	things	tend	to	go	in
the	Macauley	house.	But	you’re	not	like	that.”	He	exhales	sharply	and
his	voice	dips	lower.	“You’re	not	like	anybody.	I’ve	known	that	since	we
were	kids,	and	I	just—I	fucked	up.	I	finally	had	my	chance	with	you
and	I	fucked	it	all	up.”

He	waits	a	beat	for	me	to	say	something,	but	I	can’t	yet.	“I’m
sorry,”	he	says,	shifting	again.	“I	shouldn’t	have	come.	I	sprang	this	on
you	out	of	nowhere.	I	didn’t	mean	to	ruin	your	big	night.”

The	crowd	is	thinning,	the	night	air	cooling.	My	father	will	be	here
soon.	I	finally	look	up,	and	it’s	every	bit	as	unnerving	as	I	thought	it
would	be.	“You	really	hurt	me,	Nate.	You	can’t	just	ride	here	on	your
motorcycle	 with...all	 _this_ ”—I	 gesture	 around	 his	 face—“and	 expect
everything	to	be	okay.	It’s	not.”

“I	know.”	Nate’s	eyes	search	mine.	“But	I	was	hoping...I	mean,
what	you	were	saying	before.	How	we	were	friends.	I	wanted	to	ask	you
—it’s	probably	stupid,	after	all	this,	but	you	know	Porter	Cinema,	on


Clarendon?	 The	 one	 that	 plays	 older	 stuff?	 They’ve	 got	 the	 second
Divergent	 movie	 there.	 I	 was,	 um,	 wondering	 if	 you	 want	 to	 go
sometime.”

Long	pause.	My	thoughts	are	a	tangled	mess,	but	I’m	sure	of	one
thing—if	I	tell	him	no,	it’ll	be	out	of	pride	and	self-preservation.	Not
because	it’s	what	I	want.	“As	friends?”

“As	whatever	you	want.	I	mean,	yeah.	Friends	would	be	great.”
“You	hate	those	movies,”	I	remind	him.
“I	really	do.”	He	sounds	regretful,	and	I	almost	crack	a	smile.	“I
like	you	more,	though.	I	miss	you	like	crazy.”	I	furrow	my	brow	at	him
and	he	quickly	adds,	“As	a	friend.”	We	stare	at	each	other	for	a	few
seconds	until	his	jaw	twitches.	“Okay.	Since	I’m	being	honest	here,
more	than	a	friend.	But	I	get	that’s	not	where	your	head	is.	I’d	still	like
to	take	you	to	a	shitty	movie	and	hang	out	with	you	for	a	couple	hours.
If	you’ll	let	me.”

My	cheeks	burn,	and	the	corners	of	my	mouth	keep	trying	to	turn
upward.	My	face	is	a	fickle	traitor.	Nate	sees	it	and	brightens,	but	when
I	don’t	say	anything	he	pulls	at	the	neck	of	his	T-shirt	and	drops	his
head	like	I’ve	already	turned	him	down.	“Well.	Just	think	about	it,
okay?”

I	take	a	deep	breath.	Being	dumped	by	Nate	was	heartbreaking,
and	the	idea	of	opening	myself	up	to	that	kind	of	hurt	again	is	scary.
But	I	put	myself	on	the	line	for	him	once,	when	I	told	him	how	I	felt
about	him.	And	again,	when	I	helped	get	him	out	of	jail.	He’s	worth	at
least	a	third	time.	“If	you’ll	admit	that	 _Insurgent_ 	is	a	cinematic	tour	de
force	and	you’re	dying	to	see	it,	I’ll	consider	your	proposal.”

Nate	snaps	his	head	up	and	gives	me	a	smile	like	the	sun	coming
out.	“ _Insurgent_ 	is	a	cinematic	tour	de	force	and	I’m	dying	to	see	it.”

Happiness	starts	bubbling	through	me,	making	it	hard	to	keep	a
straight	face.	I	manage,	though,	because	I’m	not	going	to	make	things
_that_ 	easy	on	him.	Nate	can	sit	through	the	entire	series	before	we	leave
the	friend	zone.	“That	was	fast,”	I	say.	“I	expected	more	resistance.”

```
“I	already	wasted	too	much	time.”
I	give	a	small	nod.	“All	right,	then.	I’ll	call	you.”
Nate’s	smile	fades	a	little.	“We	never	exchanged	numbers,	though,
```

did	we?”

“Still	have	your	burner	phone?”	I	ask.	Mine’s	been	charging	in	my
closet	for	three	months.	Just	in	case.

His	face	lights	up	again.	“Yeah.	I	do.”
The	gentle	but	insistent	honk	of	a	horn	penetrates	my	brain.	Dad’s
BMW	idles	directly	behind	us,	and	Mom	lowers	the	passenger	window
to	peer	outside.	If	I	had	to	use	one	word	to	describe	her	expression	it
would	be	 _resigned._ 	“There’s	my	ride,”	I	tell	Nate.

He	reaches	for	my	hand	and	squeezes	it	quickly	before	letting	go,
and	I	swear	to	God,	actual	sparks	shoot	across	my	skin.	“Thanks	for
not	telling	me	to	get	lost.	I’ll	wait	to	hear	from	you,	okay?	Whenever
you’re	ready.”

“Okay.”	I	move	past	him	toward	my	parents’	car	and	feel	him	turn
to	watch	me.	I	finally	let	myself	smile,	and	now	that	I’ve	started,	I	can’t
stop.	That’s	okay,	though.	I	catch	his	reflection	in	the	backseat	window,
and	he	can’t	either.


So	many	people	helped	me	along	the	journey	from	idea	to	publication,
and	I	will	be	forever	grateful	to	all	of	them.	First,	a	profound	thank-you
to	Rosemary	Stimola	and	Allison	Remcheck,	without	whom	this	book
wouldn’t	exist.	Thank	you	for	taking	a	chance	on	me,	and	for	your
brilliant	advice	and	unwavering	support.

To	Krista	Marino,	thank	you	for	being	an	incredible	editor	and	for
your	 deep	 understanding	 of	 my	 story	 and	 its	 characters.	 Your
insightful	 feedback	 and	 guidance	 strengthened	 this	 book	 in	 ways	 I
didn’t	 realize	 were	 possible.	 To	 all	 the	 team	 at	 Random
House/Delacorte	 Press,	 I’m	 honored	 to	 be	 counted	 among	 your
authors.

Writers	are	so	much	better	when	they’re	part	of	a	community.	To
Erin	Hahn,	my	first	critique	partner,	thank	you	for	being	an	honest
critic,	a	tireless	cheerleader,	and	a	good	friend.	Thank	you	Jen	Fulmer,
Meredith	Ireland,	Lana	Kondryuk,	Kathrine	Zahm,	Amelinda	Berube,
and	Ann	Marjory	K	for	your	thoughtful	reads	and	words	of	wisdom.
Every	one	of	you	made	this	book	better.

Thank	 you,	 Amy	 Capelin,	 Alex	 Webb,	 Bastian	 Schlueck,	 and
Kathrin	Nehm	for	bringing	 _One	of	Us	Is	Lying_ 	to	audiences	around	the
world.

Thank	you	to	my	sister,	Lynne,	at	whose	kitchen	table	I	sat	and
announced,	“I’m	finally	going	to	write	a	book.”	You’ve	read	every	word
I’ve	written	since,	and	believed	in	me	when	all	this	seemed	like	a	pipe
dream.	Thank	you,	Luis	Fernando,	Gabriela,	Carolina,	and	Erik	for
your	love	and	support,	and	for	putting	up	with	my	laptop	at	family
gatherings.	Thank	you,	Jay	and	April,	who	are	part	of	every	sibling
story	I	write,	and	Julie	for	always	checking	in	on	book	progress.

Deep	gratitude	to	my	mom	and	dad	for	instilling	in	me	a	love	of
reading	and	the	discipline	required	for	writing.	And	to	my	second-
grade	teacher,	the	late	Karen	Hermann	Pugh,	who	was	the	first	to	ever


call	me	a	storyteller.	I	wish	I	could	have	thanked	you	in	person.

All	the	love	in	the	world	to	my	kind,	smart,	and	funny	son,	Jack.	I
am	proud	of	you	always.

And	 finally,	 to	 my	 readers—thank	 you	 from	 the	 bottom	 of	 my
heart	for	choosing	to	spend	your	time	with	this	book.	I	couldn’t	be
happier	to	share	it	with	you.
