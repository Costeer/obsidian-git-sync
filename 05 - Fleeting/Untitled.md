I would say that i am mostly skilled at exploring the undersides of resupply drops as well as lightly bumping my teammates with my hellpod but my specialty has to be my ability to test the explosive capabilities of cluster bombs, witch i think makes me an engineer  

I hope to be available as often as i can (witch may not be as often as i would like)

I hope to find a place full of democracy loving Helldivers like myself that 

no this is the first time 

I ready to blindly follow the orders of high command just like i learned at helldiver training

I hope to help superearth
